    This week we continue to do data visualisation with Matplotlib, we learn what are figures and axes, how to customize your plot by changing the elements in your axes, and having multiple subplots in a figure. In the end, we figure out a few slow fire type pokemon, can you guess what they are?

- title: Python Zero to Hero - Ep.7 - Unit testing with Pytest
  vid: K_PN5sfaG-k
  tags: Python Zero to Hero
  description: |
    Update: the reason why I cannot install pytest in my environment is that I have installed conda yesterday and it messed up the path. Somehow conda overrides the pyenv paths so they cannot exist together. You can either keep it and use `python -m pytest` every time instead of `pytest` or, like me, remove conda so it works again.

    Testing is very important in software development. Unit testing is the smallest building block of your tests. It locks a unit of your code in place so making debugging much easier. Today we will use Pytest, a popular testing library in Python, to do some unit testing. We only cover the basics today and if you are interested to learn more about testing using pytest or other libraries, please leave your comment at my [Twitch channel](https://t.co/7sqvTilzF1?amp=1)
