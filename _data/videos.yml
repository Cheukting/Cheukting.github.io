    Python is one of the programming languages that has a huge open-source supply chain. There are over 400,000 Python packages on Python Package Index (PyPI) and many more on other registries. Making sure this and the wider Python ecosystem are secure is a huge job and requires consistent contributions. Thanks to OpenSSF’s Alpha-Omega project, we now have a PSF Security Developer-in-Residence whose responsibility includes a security audit of the PyPI codebase and infrastructure, improving security practices, and establishing metrics on security posture to show impact. In this talk, we will have the PSF Security Developer-in-Residence himself talk about the effort that has been put in and plans to make Python safer. We will also have one of the PSF board of directors talking about what this means for the Python community and as community members how we can contribute to this effort.

Many people compare it to Pandas, the goto package for tabular data management for years. However, there is still some confusion regarding what Polars really is, whether or not it is more efficient than Pandas and if you can just replace Pandas with Polars. Hopefully, by the end of the talk, all of these questions will be answered and for people new to Polars, they will feel encouraged to try it out and more confident to make the switch.

    Mozilla has been promoting WASM for years, on the other hand, HTMX is gaining attraction. Question is, do we want more frontend or more backend? Do we still need to write JavaScripts?

    In the first half of the talk we would explore the history of WASM and the Iodide project, what they enable and the closing of the Iodide project. Then we will talk about the rise of the Pyodide project and what this project enables - including another popular framework - PyScript. There will be some quick code demo of both Pyodide and PyScript.

    In the second half of the talk, we will switch our attention to HTMX, what's the idea behind it and how it can be used to access AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server-Sent Events directly in HTML. There will also be some code demos of how to use HTMX, especially using it together with Django.

    In the last part of the talk, there will be a conclusion, do we want more backend or more frontend? And most importantly, will web developers ever need to write JavaScript anymore?

    Goal
    The attendee of this talk will explore several popular tools in recent years which will make them rethink their approach to building their applications. Hopefully, by seeing the live demos, they are encouraged to try these tools out and learn more about the use case and how it can help them in future projects.

  vid: 7ih7LbK6ODo
  tags:
    - Conference
  description: |
    Last year, Sam Gross, the author of nogil fork on Python 3.9, demonstrated the GIL can be removed. For scientific programs which use heavy CPU-bound processes, it could be a huge performance improvement. In this talk, we will see if this is true and compare the no-gil version to the original.

    In this talk, we will have a look at what is no-gil Python and how it may improve the performance of some scientific calculations. First of all, we will touch upon the background knowledge of the Python GIL, what is it and why it is needed. On the contrary, why it is stopping multi-threaded CPU processes to take advantage of multi-core machines.

    After that, we will have a look at no-gil Python, a fork of CPython 3.9 by Sam Gross, and how it provides an alternative to using Python with no GIL, demonstrating it could be the future of the newer versions of Python. With that, we will try out this version of Python in some popular yet calculation-heavy algorithms in scientific programming and data sciences e.g. PCA, clustering, categorization and data manipulation with Scikit-learn and Pandas. We will compare the performance of this no-gil version with the original standard CPython distribution.

    This talk is for Pythonistas who have intermediate knowledge of Python and are interested in using Python for scientific programming or data science. It may shine some light on having a more efficient way of using Python in their tasks and interest in trying the no-gil version of Python.

    Have you been troubled by Python code that took too long to run? Do you want to know why and how to improve?

    In this workshop, we will introduce Numba - a JIT compiler that is designed to speed up numerical calculations. Most people found all of it is like a mystery - It sounds like magic, but how does it work? Under what conditions does it work? And because of it, new users found it hard to start using it and it requires a steep learning curve to get the hang of it. This workshop will provide all the knowledge that you need to make Numba works for you.

    This workshop is for Data scientists or developers who have math-heavy code that would like to speed up with the benefit of Numpy and Numba.

    In this talk, we will visit some valuable tools in Pytest, for example, parameterize, fixture and xfail. All of them provided what problem these tool is trying to solve, an example use case and an example code.

    In this talk, through some examples and demos of PyScript, we will see how to use it - just include the CDN URL, understand that it is a frontend-only Python that runs on the browser and learn the fact that it can work with javascript in conjunction.

    After that, we will look at what is under the hood - Pyodide - which is a Python distribution for the browser. It is what is essential to power PyScript. We will discover what is the difference between using PyScript and Pyodide.

    Finally, we will conclude what is already available in PyScirpt like which library you can run on PyScript and which ones are still yet to come. In the end, we will answer the question - Will PyScript replace Django?

    This talk is for those who are curious about PyScript and the idea of running Python in the browser in general. We will assume no piror knowledge about it.

    Using Numba Effectively Today - Cheuk Ting Ho

    Have you ever heard of Numba? It is (mainly) a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler to make your math-heavy Python code run faster under certain conditions. Most people found all of it is like a mystery - It sounds like magic, but how does it work? Under what conditions does it work? And because of it, new users found it hard to start using it and it requires a steep learning curve to get the hang of it.

    This talk requires no prior experience. Through demos, we will explore in what situation Numba works, when it does not and the reason why. We will also look at some cases where we can make Numba works by changing a few things in your code. Hopefully, by the end of the talk, you will have a better understanding of how Numba works before you even start using it. This knowledge can save you some time on try and error, making your experience in using it better.

    I left Hong Kong, the place that I was born and lived for 30 years, 5 years ago with no technical experience. (Except for a few programming experience in University time, mainly serves my research studies) Moving to London, a city where technology is in high demand, opens a lot of doors for me. Here I know about open-source and Python. I learnt Python, been to lots of meet-ups and made lots of friends. I was welcomed by the community with open arms, in here I have met smart people, dedicated people, fun and nerdy people, and all of them are lovely. I am not joking if I say Python gave me this new life. I am so proud to be a Pythonistas, grateful about where I am now that I would like to share my journey with you. I hope everyone will find their journey in this amazing community.

    Cheuk Ting Ho - Open-source in the eyes of a Minority Contributor | PyData Fest Amsterdam 2020

    In the first part of this talk, I will talk about my personal experience in contributing to open-source. From learning how to make a Pull Request on GitHub to maintaining libraries. From attending my first meetup to co-organizing conferences. I will tell you what I observe as a self-identifying female. My opinion on certain events that happened. And what “help” do we, minorities in the community, need.

    In the second part of the talk, I will change to a more subjective angle to look at the diversity issues in the open-source community, especially in Python and Data Science communities. I will try to address what effort has been made and what more we can do. In the end, I will try to convince you all the be our ally and to do the right thing to make our community more inclusive and diverse.

  vid: YqoBvEaAU5w
  tags:
    - PyConAU
  description: |
    At the start, we will be using `dir` to look into the secret functions Python objects have. Eg:
    `__getitem__`, `__iter__` and `__next__` Then, we will investigate where is the dunder function goes? Why is it not accessible. And at the end, we will see how dunder functions can change the identity of the Python objects.

    This talk is for attendees who have just begin their Python journey. By explaining the dunder functions and the nature of Python objects, attendees will have a better understanding of why Python is fundamentally different from other programming languages. Hopefully, this knowledge will help them out when they continue their Python journeys.

    **Join our [free data science workshop at PyCon Africa](https://t.co/bS4nlglBmh?amp=1)**

    Starting from this week we will be doing machine learning. Linear regression is considered to be machine learning 101, and from seeing how linear regression works we will have a basic idea of how we can draw conclusions and make predictions with data.

    Moving from iterators late week, we have introduced generators (or generator functions). Which lets you create iterators just like writing a function, with yield. It also got a "send" method which lets you pass information from one iterator to another, setting the stage for async in Python.

- title: Python Zero to Hero - Ep.7 - Unit testing with Pytest
  vid: K_PN5sfaG-k
  tags: Python Zero to Hero
  description: |
    Update: the reason why I cannot install pytest in my environment is that I have installed conda yesterday and it messed up the path. Somehow conda overrides the pyenv paths so they cannot exist together. You can either keep it and use `python -m pytest` every time instead of `pytest` or, like me, remove conda so it works again.

    Testing is very important in software development. Unit testing is the smallest building block of your tests. It locks a unit of your code in place so making debugging much easier. Today we will use Pytest, a popular testing library in Python, to do some unit testing. We only cover the basics today and if you are interested to learn more about testing using pytest or other libraries, please leave your comment at my [Twitch channel](https://t.co/7sqvTilzF1?amp=1)

As an active members and event organisers (and also on the minority side of the gender) in the Python community, we have alway been concern by the question of - Do we truly have a problem in diversity? Especially, gender diversity. We would like to find out the truth, by data science, and see if we can find a clue why and how we can fix it.

    Network analysis is getting more and more attention in Business Intelligence, people hope to get information out of the structure of an organization or a communication network. In this talk, we use the hotel room search requests from travel agents, including online public website, B2C, B2B and B2B2C, to build a relational network among them. By using this network as an example, we demonstrate how insights can be extract by studying network properties.

- title: Fuzzy Matching Smart Way of Finding Similar Names Using Fuzzywuzzy
  vid: NRAqIjXaZvw
  tags:
    - EuroPython
  description: |
    Matching strings should be one of the first natural language processing problem that human encounter since we start use computer to handle data. Unlike numerical value which has an exact logic to compare them, it is very hard to say how alike two strings are for a computer. One may compare them character by character and have an idea of how many characters in the pair of stings are the same. Unfortunately in most application we need computer to perceive strings like we do and therefore we have to use fuzzy matching. Fuzzy matching on names is never straight forward though, the definition of how “difference” of two names are really depends case by case. For example with restaurant names, matching of words like “cafe” “bar” and “restaurant” are consider less valuable then matching of some other less common words. Also, do we consider company names that matches partly (like “Happy Unicorn company” and Happy Unicorn co.”) are the same?

  vid: bQ2Qu63SYHw
  tags:

  description: |
    One main application of AI (artificial intelligence) is in NLP (natural language processing) which allows the machine to understand neutral languages and learn a lot from the context of texts. With tools like Keras (using Tensorflow as backend) we can build a neutral network with only 3 layers (Embedding, LSTM, Softmax output) in order to "teach" a machine to generate articles, plays or speeches in the style of the training corpus and have lots of fun. Will it be like a Shakespearean actor in one instance and talk like Trump in another? How well is the AI against human in writings now and in the future? How creative could an AI be?
