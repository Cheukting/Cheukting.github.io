    Last week I have been to a meetup where a team of software developers from Dublin talks about their newest invention — TerminusDB, a graph database that stores data like git. My reaction was like, what? Imagine all the cool things you can do with git: time travel, branching and forking etc, you can do them with your data.

    In this blog post, we will showcase the power of Ably and Tensorflow.js. Everything will be just on the frontend, in just one html. It’s a demo, in production you may not do things this way but you can have a feeling how powerful Ably is and how you can use deep learning model with just a few lines of code.

    Since we have replaced file cabinets with computers, the most efficient way of storing massive amounts of data is using databases and users can retrieve the data that they need by using queries. But these queries never work quite like how a human brain works. Have you ever imagine that data can be stored as a knowledge graph and a query can take care of human reasoning?
