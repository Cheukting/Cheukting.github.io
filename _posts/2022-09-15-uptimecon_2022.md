I was invited to Uptime Conference back in May this year. It is a conference organised by Aivan.io

## Arrival and Speakers Dinner

The organisers are very kind to organise all my travel and accommodation for me. There is minor trouble with EasyJet but I arrived in the airport, got picked up and transfer to the very nice hotel next to the venue.

After a short rest, we went for the speakers' dinner. It's great to be able to chat with some industry leaders and other developer advocates.

After the tech rehearsal, we chill in the speakers' green room. Talk to more speakers. Then there's the conference opening and keynote. It is a keynote by Jason who I chat to yesterday at the speaker dinner. The talk is about the SSPL licenses that create a storm in the OSS community for both MongoDB and Elastic. He explains what freedom in open source truly means.

I make use of the time at lunch to talk to various developers and conference attendees. They all have different backgrounds and some of them are not using Python mainly. I think it is a rare opportunity for me to talk to developers that Python is not their main language.

My talk is in the afternoon. It is about an open-source project that I have been involved in the past.

In the evening we have an after party on a boat. It is an extraordinary experience. I got the chance to talk to other developer advocates and it feels like a mini DevRelCon is happening.

## Uptime Conf 2022 - Day 2

The second day is a slow start for me, I have to save myself for the PyCon UK coming up the next day and catch up with work. But I got a chance to talk to folks at the conference. Including engineering managers alike.

Time flies and that's the last keynote by the founder of the Apache Software Foundation.

Then it's the closing. Originally I don't expect to have so much fun and make so many great connections as it is not a Python conference which I am very used to. Everyone I met at the conference are nice and the organisers are very welcoming. Overall it is a great experience.

## One more thing

They have real time STT (done by professional real people) thought out the whole conference. The other conference that I have seen it are PyCon UK and PyCon Ireland and I think it is a great feature to be inclusive.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow, kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/uptimecon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@uptimecon</a> for having live closed captions during the conference talks.
