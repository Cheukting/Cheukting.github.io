After having this idea for a while. We finally have our 1st PyScript Dojo where people can learn Python and have fun at the same time. As PyScript is still very new, we are not ambitious to ask for creative projects but to get people interested and start writing PyScript for the first time.

Thankfully, we have Anna, organiser of PyLadies London, organising this evernt for us. She is very professional and makes sure everything goes smoothly and everyone is happy at the event. We are also very glad to have Infinity work hosting us at their beautiful office which transform into a theatre during the event.

The event starts with people networking and having a bit. Then after a brief introduction by Anna, my colleague Nicholas gives out the background information and some technical knowledge about PyScript. Because he is such a good teacher, even though the details of PyScript can be very technical, he can explain in a way that even kids can understand.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our first <a href="https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pyscript_dev</a> dojo <a href="https://t.co/Oq1X5OoUob">pic.twitter.com/Oq1X5OoUob</a></p>&mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1584979288142807041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then I point the participants to try our PyScript by visiting the workshop materials I prepared and the official website of PyScript where they can check out the documentation and examples of what PyScript can do. I am so glad that people are working in small groups and most of them can finish the workshop materials. They also raise some very interesting questions and that helps me to understand from a learner's perspective what is not clear enough and needs clearer instruction and better explanation.

Overall, it is a great event and there are plans to have another in Berlin next month. I hope it will be great as well.
