 So, we have regular meetings to talk about the tools and strategies regarding remote meetings. I feel that it will be good to summaries the discussion and share the knowledge with people who are interested.

## How many tools?

A constant debate will be: would you prefer one tool for all or many tools each do their best.

Obviously, there will be a higher bar to learn to use many tools.

 > Even for tech savvy people, many new tools can be overwhelming, there's a learning curve. less tech-aware people it may be even harder - one or two at a time should be enough.

 But on the other hands, there are people thinks that there is advantage to use the best tool for the job.

 So what is the minimal set is?

> There's a question of - how many tools at the same time is too much, and also - how many in total.

Someone also points out:

> we are reaching the point of too many tools - three is already too much.

## Audio VS Video?

There is also discussion about is using video essential for a call? Or Audio is enough so people can focus on the task at hands? (e.g. note-taking, pair programming)

People who praise using video calls do have a solid reason:

> (Using only audio) missing the video connection, especially in sales its better for the personal connection.

However, people who prefer audio also get a good point:

> Reliability is one of the reasons to go primarily audio, also it frees the screen to use the tools like stickynote board.

After all, I think it really depends on the use case that you have.
