I am finally back in this beautiful country and meeting all these awesome people at PyCon Namibia!

## Day 1

After a long flight that lasts more than 10 hours from London to Frankfurt and then Windhoek, I finally set foot in this beautiful country again! I was super tired but I cannot wait to meet everyone at the conference, so once I am done with everything at the airport, I head to the conference directly.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello Namibia 🇳🇦 we are on our way to <a href="https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyConNA</a> <a href="https://t.co/gbTcFbRi8T">pic.twitter.com/gbTcFbRi8T</a></p>&mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1627963334698930176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

When I arrived, I was so happy to meet friends that I have not seen for 3 years. They are just having a tea break and were chilling by the pool. After registering, there is Juan-Luis's workshop - he was teaching some beginners level Python.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Juan-Luis is giving a workshop <a href="https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyConNA</a> <a href="https://t.co/5tfvzikTfR">pic.twitter.com/5tfvzikTfR</a></p>&mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1627976829465141249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then it's lunch, we are eating by the pool, the environment is very nice. I was a bit tired so I have not got many opportunities to talk to other conference attendees except Juan-Luis who was sitting next to me. Will try better tomorrow.

After lunch, I only stayed for a bit as I was so tired after the overnight flight. I went back to the hotel a bit earlier and then have our team meeting.

After resting for a bit, I went to have dinner and then a social drink with the speakers. We went back to the place where we performed at an open mic night back in 2019. However, this time there aren't any open mics and we just chill and drink.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A very intentional drink last night with speakers of <a href="https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyConNA</a> from everywhere (+1 random friendly folk from Switzerland) <a href="https://t.co/MddooB2PQG">pic.twitter.com/MddooB2PQG</a></p>&mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628288879672406017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Day 2

Today is the day we have the Humble Data workshop. But before, there are talks that are related to starting a career in technology and the attendees are very keen to ask questions in the panel session.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet the panel at career panel session <a href="https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyConNA</a> <a href="https://t.co/DXqe2A4WXP">pic.twitter.com/DXqe2A4WXP</a></p>&mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628306252055846913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

During the breaks and lunchtime, we tried to help as many participants to get the workshop materials and Anaconda installer copied over to their computers and start installing Anaconda (if they have not got it installed yet). Then after lunch, we have the Humble Data workshop. My friend John is showing how to open Anaconda navigator and explored some of the tools that are offered in Anaconda distribution. In the meanwhile, I troubleshoot for some folks who have trouble installing.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyConNA</a> At a moment busy installing anaconda software with <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cheukting_ho</a> ,it was really a great chance of learning how to use anaconda software and cope python with through anaconda 🤗 <a href="https://t.co/NYaL7UnGM7">pic.twitter.com/NYaL7UnGM7</a></p>&mdash; 02_luxury01 (@enias_jonas) <a href="https://twitter.com/enias_jonas/status/1628603840097386496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Then we started, after a brief introduction, participants work in groups and they are all using Jupyter notebook to learn Python. The portion of participants, including the students, who are absolute beginners in Python is quite high. And most of them got through the first chapter of the workshop and learnt all the Python basics. We also had a fun quiz at the end and everyone was having a good time.

After that, the organisers invited the speakers for dinner to sample some local cuisine. On the menu, some food is unique in Namibia including Mopani (a type of worm) and Smily (goat head). I was loving it but for some speakers who are from Europe the best things for the night are spinach and fish.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyConNA</a> organisers (including our camera man) for the amazing speaker dinner!

## Day 3

When I arrived at the conference, the talks in the morning has already started. So I just chilled with some organisers by the pool. After the coffee break in the morning, I attended a few talks.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Andreea is talking about what is Data Science <a href="https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyConNA</a> <a href="https://t.co/57v7NJ7Kmy">pic.twitter.com/57v7NJ7Kmy</a></p>&mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628682677338402822?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After listening to the opening of John's talk, I was summoned to the recruitment session to talk about Anaconda. We are not hiring in Namibia right now so I just briefly mention our company culture and that we support open-source projects.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Recruitment session <a href="https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyConNA</a> <a href="https://t.co/HtIOuKve5p">pic.twitter.com/HtIOuKve5p</a></p>&mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628698336512409612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After the recruitment session, I sat down to prepare [my talk](https://youtu.be/PCohAKCn1XQ), it is right after lunch.

After my talk, there will be a workshop about Diátaxis documentation framework by Daniele. I have been to the workshop more than once, I am a big fan.

During the tea break, I was lucky to meet the chef that made us yummy cakes during the tea time. Some girls even ask her for her secret recipes.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have amazing cakes during the tea time <a href="https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyConNA</a> salute to the chef 👩‍🍳 <a href="https://t.co/4xsWof2wzm">pic.twitter.com/4xsWof2wzm</a></p>&mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628749473223434240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After the tea break, there are a few more talks, then it is the lighting talk and the closing. Thank you so much to the organisers for the amazing conference! I hope I will be back once again in the future.
