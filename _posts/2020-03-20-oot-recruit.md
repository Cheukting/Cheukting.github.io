## OOT is recrOOTing!

We’re an [open-source project](https://www.optoutools.com/) building tools to help women engage with healthy online discussion. We rely on donations and people's time to build tools that fight online misogyny and harassment. If you can spare some hours of your week then take a look at the roles we need desperately need and see if you can help.

## User researcher

If you believe women should have equal access to digital spaces and want to help OOT better understand online misogyny using qualitative and quantitative data, then reach out! We need user researchers to actively engage with the community, compile research, and act as user advocates within the OOT maintainer community to help ensure we’re building tech that really protects the most vulnerable online. You’ll work closely with our social scientists and data scientists to make sure we’re building and researching the right things.

## UX & Graphic Designer

If you have an interest in designing products that live at the intersection of natural language processing, machine learning, politics in digital conversational spaces and feminism, then contact us! The role will be focusing on the usability of our browser extension and make our website look sweeet!

## Yes, I am here!

If one of the above describes you and you are interested in joining the team, please email to [opt.out.tool@gmail.com](mailto:opt.out.tool@gmail.com) we would love to hear from you.
