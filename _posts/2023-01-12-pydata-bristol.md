My first event speaking live in 2023 is at the PyData Bristol meetup, which is also my first PyData Bristol. I am so excited and here is what I see and do there.

## Getting there

In the morning, I got notified that my train to Bristol has been cancelled. Recently we have train strikes in the UK so I am not surprised that something will go wrong with my train. Luckily it was not a last-minute thing. I decided to get on the train before it and arrive at Bristol a bit earlier than planned.

After boarding the train, I realised that the reason why the train was cancelled is that the region near Bristol was flooded so the trains are disrupted. Now I just hope that the train going home will be fine.

I ended up not arriving at Bristol much earlier than planned due to the train that I was on was also delayed. However, it didn't matter as I was on time for the meetup.

## PyData Bristol

When I arrived at the venue, the first person that I saw was my colleague Valerio. It is always good to see familiar faces in a new place. Then, another organiser of the meetup come and greet me, with their help, I tested the computer setup and we are good to go.

As my talk is in the second half after the pizza break I got a chance to chat with the organisers a bit before the meetup. I was also spotting who would I be interviewing during the break.

Then the meetup started, it is so exciting. The organisers made a very good introduction and I like the "ChatGPT nonsense of the month" session.

The first talk is quite interesting, we all learnt a bit about how computer chips are made with plasma and unsupervised learning from the talk by Greg.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First talk <a href="https://twitter.com/PyDataBristol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PyDataBristol</a> is by Greygwho is a Physicist from University of Exeter talking about unsupervised learning in plasma physics <a href="https://t.co/w9wXMqlZ0o">pic.twitter.com/w9wXMqlZ0o</a></p>&mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1613608643408035874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Nest we have a lightning talk about federated learning, I am very impressed by the speaker Akiko, I think it would be great if she gives a full talk next time.

Then it is the pizza break. I also use this chance to set up my presentation, and record and interview some people I met at the conference.

Then I gave my talk. I was so excited to be giving a talk again. I think I am a bit addicted to it.

After my talk, it's a lighting talk about NBFire, a cloud service to host your notebook on the cloud and run it on schedule. I think the idea is quite cool. I think our cloud notebook should have a run-on-schedule function as well.

And that is the end of the meetup. Some people will head to the pub for the after party, sadly I have to catch a train home. I would have spent the night in Bristol and joined the pub but I also miss my bed at home. It's always a difficult choice for me as I enjoy chatting with the folks at PyData Bristol. I wish I can go to the meetup again soon.
