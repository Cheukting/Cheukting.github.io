## FAQ

**English is not my mother's tough, is that ok?**

So do I and many of us. This is not an English class and we will not judge you. However, we expect our participants to be comfortable using English to communicate as the workshops are conducted in English.


**Can I join the rapid presentation club without joining the workshop?**

Yes of course, we welcome newcomers, however, it is recommended to have a look at our workshops if you are a new speaker or want to improve your presentation skills.


**I want to join the workshop but the time you offer does not suit my schedule.**

We will try to offer alternative times for more workshops in the future. Please get in touch and let us know you are interested and we will notify you when there is a new workshop that may suit your schedule.
