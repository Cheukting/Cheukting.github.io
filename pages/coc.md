We expect all participants to join the workshops and the club to follow the code of conduct and to be open, considerate and respectful to everyone in the group. The scope of the code of conduct includes the duration of the activities happening in the club and the workshops. Here are the behaviours that reinforce these values:


- Being open. Open to collaboration in group activities.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We're - receptive to constructive comments and criticism.
- Showing empathy towards others. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
- Being considerate towards others.
- Being respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.
