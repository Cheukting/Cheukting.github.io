        <title>Why I support DjangoCon Africa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently there have been debates on the internet regarding the choice of the country where &lt;a href=&quot;https://2023.djangocon.africa/&quot;&gt;DjangoCon Africa&lt;/a&gt; will be held. There is &lt;a href=&quot;https://vurt.eu/articles/on-safety/&quot;&gt;a very touching and powerful blog post&lt;/a&gt; by my friend Daniele Procida which was echoed in the Python community. I am not without thoughts and after discussion with other PSF board members and the PyCon APAC community, I would like to put some of my thoughts here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First of all, I have to clarify that I am representing here my own opinion, not representing the PSF board or any communities that I am part of.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happened-with-djangocon-africa&quot;&gt;What happened with DjangoCon Africa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DjangoCon Africa applied for a PSF grant and since the grants working group cannot make a recommendation, it was passed to the board to make a decision. During the board meeting in September, there was a brief discussion regarding choosing Tanzania, a country where homosexuality is illegal, as appropriate. Unfortunately, due to a lack of time to discuss this issue properly, the vote to provide the grants did not pass and another vote need to be carried out. This caused delays in the grant approval and spake debates throughout the communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the grant, at the time of this blog post, is approved. I cannot ignore the arguments on both sides, especially when I am involved in several international Python conferences, being one of the board members of PSF and someone who just joined the grants working group. I would like to listen to different opinions from the Python community and formulate some thoughts while this issue, the criteria for giving grants, will be discussed further in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PSF board and grants working group also decided to review the decision-making process to avoid delays of any grants in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-support-djangocon-africa&quot;&gt;Why I support DjangoCon Africa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, while I was serving the EPS board, I insisted that when deciding on the location of EuroPython, picking a country that is relatively safe for everyone (especially folks from the LQBTQ+ community) is important. However, this is not the same situation for DjangoCon Africa, in a lot of African countries, homosexuality is illegal (some even with the death penalty), and although there are several countries where homosexuality is not illegal, most of them do not have a noticeable size of Python community and some of them are generally not safe to travel to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organisers of DjangoCon Africa have made an effort to uphold the standard of a welcoming and inclusive community. The conference itself has a code of conduct and from my experience with the Django community, I entrust them would be able to create an oasis (a safe and welcoming environment at the conference) in a desert (not so friendly local law and culture). The choice of the location of the conference is limited, the local law is something that the organisers have no control over. Is it fair to remove support to a community where financial support would be most needed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe we cannot rigidly impose the same standard in Europe on a continent that is culturally, historically, economically and politically so different, I think that would be arrogant and ignorant about how privileged we are to be in a society where people can freely be who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-be-inclusive-and-welcoming&quot;&gt;How to be inclusive and welcoming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand, that even if the conference is an oasis for folks to feel safe, they still have to travel through the desert to get there. It is legitimate to not put yourself at risk if you think it is unsafe to go there. However, in cases like this choosing Tanzania to host DjangoCon Africa does not mean that the organisers are intentionally excluding an under-represented group of people, it is a lack of options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our world is not perfect, there will be situations that it is safe for one under-represented group but not for another. I think the key is to have an open and civil discussion when making the decision. Have the organisers considered the safety and needs of some groups of people, especially the under-represented groups? Has the opinion of the community been heard? What are the alternatives and if there has to be an exclusion to one under-represented group, is there an inclusion to another?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, we have figured out how to include folks who cannot attend conferences in person for any reason. Although I agree that the experience online and in-person are different, we can try to put energy and resources into making sure the participants online can get the next best experience they can. If a conference location is rotating and there are options, make sure all under-represented groups get a chance to attend the conference every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/&quot;&gt;Python Community Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Python community are open, considerate, and respectful. This kind of discussion is uncomfortable, it is hard. But it is healthy for the community to openly talk about it respectfully so we understand the viewpoints and needs of members in the community no matter what their identities are. Look at our community and compare it to the past. We keep upholding our values and make improvements, if we can do that in the past, we can do it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not be going to DjangoCon Africa in person this year for personal reasons. I would love to go. Please support DjangoCon Africa whether you will be attending in person or not. If you want, you can donate to them and this can help more people in the African community to learn Python and opportunity to be connected to the wider community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2023.djangocon.africa/donate/&quot;&gt;Support DjangoCon Africa via donation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also happy to talk about your concern regarding of the criteria for  PSF grants in the future, or as an organiser how to make sure your conference is welcoming and inclusive. You can find my online presents on the top of this website or email me at: me [at] cheuk [dot] dev&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyCon India 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The last time I thought about going to PyCon India was in 2018, before the pandemic, however, it didn’t happen. A few years passed and I was very honoured to be invited to give a keynote at PyCon India this year at 2023. I have heard numeric things at PyCon India in the past and I have not been to this country before. So all is a little concerning and exciting for me at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arriving-hyderabad-india&quot;&gt;Arriving Hyderabad, India&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hurdle I have to jump through is getting a visa. I did some research when I received the invitation and thought I could get an e-visa easily. It turned out to not be true and I had to rush to get a paper visa, it was tricky and I had to change my travel plan but luckily I ended up getting the visa in time for PyCon India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Bye bye &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIndia2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIndia2023&lt;/a&gt; Many valuable moments, learnings, experiences..Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconindia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconindia&lt;/a&gt; for making it all happen !! See you next year 🥺 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gzf9yRXKav&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gzf9yRXKav&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sravya Yellapragada (@sravyaysk) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sravyaysk/status/1708500029269545411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 1, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a long journey, I was flying throughout the night. When I arrived at the airport in Hyderabad on the workshop day of the conference, one of the organisers, Snehith and another keynote speaker Jessica came to pick me up. It was a relief to see them as I know that I will be taken care of at the time. They drive me to the hotel where I can check in and have some rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the day at the hotel to work and prepare my keynote. There is a swimming pool and spa at the hotel, I also use this opportunity to get myself refreshed before the conference the next day. In the evening, I had dinner at the hotel with Jessica, Marcelo and Vaibhavi. The restaurant has servers that are hearing impaired and they have some simple guides on the menu to teach customers how to sign to the servers. Jessica arrived early and spent almost a week at the hotel so she was a professional at sign language by then. The food is good, I have heard biriyani is the famous local food there so we tried some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-conference---day-1&quot;&gt;The conference - day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think of India, you may have an image that it is packed with people and traffic. This also reflects a bit at the conference. We got picked up by Snehith again and we arrived at the conference. There are huge queues at the registration desk. Since we are keynote speakers they just guide us to the main auditorium where Jessica will be presenting her keynote soon. While Jessica was focusing on technical checking, I got a chance to check out the venue (there’s breakfast being served outside) and talk to some other folks at the conference. Some organisers come and say hi to me even though they are super busy with preparation. I feel their warm welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIndia?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIndia&lt;/a&gt; starts with the lamp ceremony ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LJfy6NAN5o&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LJfy6NAN5o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1707978834895597723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 30, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference started with a lamp ceremony where a beautifully decorated oil lamp was set on stage. The honorary guests, including representatives from the university and Sanchit the chair of the organising team went on stage. Some of the ladies were wearing beautiful sari and I was very excited about the ceremony. The honorary guests gathered and lit the oil lamp and I took some videos and pictures. This is like the “lighting ceremony” that I saw on TV when I was a key for the opening of some ceremony and I was very happy to get a bit of the local culture there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;First keynote of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIndia?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIndia&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sleepypioneer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@sleepypioneer&lt;/a&gt; talking about being part of the community &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Ui9Q3k7cVj&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ui9Q3k7cVj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1707979584786825542?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 30, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica gave an amazing keynote about the community. It is very thoughtful and personal as she talks about her journey transitioning to the tech industry. After that many folks gather around and talk to her. I walked around the check out the sponsor booths, they are super busy. I also got an opportunity to take an e-Tuktuk that was organised by the organiser to travel between the two university buildings used for the conference. It is my first time riding on a Tuktuk and it is fun to be zooming around the campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Gratitude in Motion: Thanks to our E-Auto Heroes for keeping &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyconIndia2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyconIndia2023&lt;/a&gt; Conference Rolling! 🚖👏 Your support and service is very valuable 🙏&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIndia?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIndia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PythonForAll?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PythonForAll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CodeCollaborateCelebrate?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CodeCollaborateCelebrate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EMKPjRI8jm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/EMKPjRI8jm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon India (@pyconindia) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconindia/status/1708460414827438266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 1, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sitting through a few talks, it is PyLadies Lunch, there is a room arranged for us and a separate catering for us as well. There is also a gorgeous cake for us. It is very cute and great to see so many women participate in the PyLadies Lunch. Participants are very passionate about the discussion and there is much interest in starting new PyLadies chapters in various Indian cities. In the end, we form groups depending on the location and hopefully, there will be more active PyLadies chapters in India soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t stay for very long after lunch. I went for a few talks (and missed Marcelo’s keynote), and then I felt very tired (maybe because of the heat), so we took an Uber and went back to the hotel and got some rest before the speaker’s dinner. We got picked up again at the hotel for the speaker dinner and it was a function room at a hotel. I liked the atmosphere of it and I got to chat with a lot of folks, including my friend from EuroPython, &lt;a href=&quot;https://in.pycon.org/2023/speakers/fs-09/&quot;&gt;Sangarshanan&lt;/a&gt;, who is also a speaker. By the time I was back, I was very tired and fell asleep immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-conference---day-2&quot;&gt;The conference - day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My keynote is the second day, there is no lamp ceremony so the day started with my keynote. It is a bit nervous as I have not given a keynote in person for a long time. But I was glad that it was well received and so many folks came and had a discussion with me. I was a bit overwhelmed. I have an onward travel later that day so I didn’t have much time. I am also gutted that I will be missing the PyCafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our amazing keynote speaker Cheuk Ting Ho (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt;) just set the stage ablaze at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIndia2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIndia2023&lt;/a&gt; Conference Day 2 🎤🔥 Get ready to be inspired and discover new horizons in Python.

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I got an opportunity to talk to &lt;a href=&quot;https://in.pycon.org/2023/speakers/fs-27/&quot;&gt;Rumanu&lt;/a&gt;, my roommate at PyCon Italy, she is a bright and bubbly girl, and it is so happy to be meeting her again. I also attended a very touching talk by &lt;a href=&quot;https://in.pycon.org/2023/speakers/fs-03/&quot;&gt;Bowrna&lt;/a&gt;, which inspired many women in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIndia2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIndia2023&lt;/a&gt;, we had an engaging speaker session by Bowrna (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bowrna_p?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@bowrna_p&lt;/a&gt;) on &amp;quot;How I restarted my career by contributing to Open Source?&amp;quot;.

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got the chance to visit the Young Learners Workshop. It is always great to see young people at a Python conference. I hope they will be the future of the Python community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;🎉Successfully wrapped up Young Learners Workshop at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIndia2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIndia2023&lt;/a&gt; with great participation from 48 school students. Big thanks to parents, teachers, guardians for supporting &amp;amp; encouraging the kids.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to JNTU-H ECE HOD, Dr. Suresh &amp;amp; Raj(blackbucks) for computer lab access. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/9AfCMyTnqS&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/9AfCMyTnqS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon India (@pyconindia) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconindia/status/1708803906439205189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 2, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch, I set with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/niharikavadluri&quot;&gt;Niharika&lt;/a&gt; and we talked about travelling to Japan as she is a frequent traveller like myself. I am so glad to be able to connect with so many amazing women at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was heading to the airport, I thought to myself, I was glad that I didn’t miss the conference due to my visa issue, I was glad that I attended PyCon India. Before going to India, I didn’t know what to expect, I have heard some issues in the past about PyCon India regarding diversity and inclusion, especially towards women. Being there in person myself, I am so happy to see the team is working so hard to drive the community in the right direction. There are a lot of amazing women I met at the conference, and I am sure the Indian community do not want to lose them. I am also glad to see many female speakers at the conference and panel sessions. Maybe next time we will see a local female keynote speaker, that’s my hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before coming to the conference, their Code of Conduct (CoC) sought advice on how to improve their CoC process, I have communicated with them and had a brief idea exchange with them. At the conference, I saw that they have put reminders of CoC everywhere and at the opening session every. You may doubt the effectiveness of it but I think at least it shows that the organisers of this conference care and it’s a big step forward.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My first NumFocus DISC Unconference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend we were very productive. We spent two full days working on projects that can improve diversity and inclusion in computation science. As a first-time participant, I was impressed by the result we have achieved at the end. I think it was a nicely organised event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;before-the-unconference-at-amsterdam&quot;&gt;Before the unconference at Amsterdam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have a successful event, I think part of it is the result of great preparation work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we gathered at the unconference, we had to propose what projects to work on and each one of them had to have a suggested outcome. This is very important as we do not want to just spend a weekend talking about things, feeling good and that’s it. We want actual outputs that can benefit the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, we also have a few office hours that participants can join and get to know each other, new participants can get a feeling of what the unconference is like etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accommodation and venue have been nicely organised by the NumFocus staff and we have support in arranging our transportation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-that-i-have-worked-on&quot;&gt;Project that I have worked on&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived late due to bad weather and the flight was severely delayed. I was told that at the beginning there were votes on which projects to work on and people formed groups to brainstorm how to approach the goal. When I arrived there were already a lot of ideas noted down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to join the project that was creating a mentoring guide. From my experience, it is hard to run a mentorship program or mentor someone. So it is good to have some kind of guide and help for those who want to contribute to the community via the form of mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use HackMD for collaborative writing. My groupmate and I picked which session they were interested in and started writing.  When we are not sure about anything, we just put it out on the table and discuss it. I think it was working quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://fosstodon.org/@cheukting_ho/111041492801319809/embed&quot; class=&quot;mastodon-embed&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%; border: 0&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://fosstodon.org/embed.js&quot; async=&quot;async&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;output-of-the-unconference&quot;&gt;Output of the unconference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, we want actual outputs that can benefit the community. Since most of the groups have written down something, we decided to put our work in a GitHub repository and publish it via GitBook. The project outputs are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A mentoring guide for open projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Project taxonomy and recommendations for Diversity Equity and Inclusion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Methodologies For Collecting Community Data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organizational Guide for Supporting Volunteers and Reducing Burnout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowhow: everything you wanted to know about applying for grants but didn’t ask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://numfocus.github.io/disc-unconference-2023-projects/en/intro.html&quot;&gt;You can find all of them here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it was an enjoyable experience. We also got a lot of networking opportunities with other members of the community. We had a lot of great conversations working on the project and during the social events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you NumFocus, especially for their staff who helped in organising this event. I think it was a great investment for the community and I have to applaud for their work on diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Source Software License 101</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you using open-source software? Are you aware of what right are you given to use that software? Are you publishing open-soft software yourself? This post is a 101 guide towards popular OSS licenses to give you an idea of what they are and how are they different. What you need to be aware of when using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post is not legal advice and if you have any concerns, please consult a legal professional for advice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;copyleft-and-permissive-licenses&quot;&gt;Copyleft and Permissive Licenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most open-source licenses can be put into 2 main categories, &lt;strong&gt;copyleft&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;permissive&lt;/strong&gt; Licenses. To put it shortly, copyleft licenses are more restrictive and any software based on any GPL component must be released as open source. On the other hand, permissive licenses provide more freedom and permit proprietary derivative works with almost no restriction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;osi-approved-licenses&quot;&gt;OSI Approved Licenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of licenses out there in the world and sometimes it is hard for developers, who are not legal experts, to judge which ones are considered “open-source” and “good to use”. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative (OSI)&lt;/a&gt; put together a list of approved licenses. I would suggest choosing a license for your project from their list (there are more than 80 of them), especially choosing &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses/?categories=popular-strong-community&quot;&gt;the ones that are popular and with a strong community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-of-the-popular-licenses&quot;&gt;Some of the Popular Licenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further help you to pick and get a basic understanding of the popular licenses, we put a list here. You can use it as a base and look into more information if any of the ones below look like what you want or if you are using anyone of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mit-license&quot;&gt;The MIT License&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;category: permissive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT License, as the name suggested, it was created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late ‘80s. It is one of the most popular and permissive free software licenses. You can do whatever you want as long as you add a copy of the original MIT license and copyright notice to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;apache-license&quot;&gt;Apache License&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;category: permissive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the name suggested, this license is released by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). It’s popular and is backed by a strong community. The Apache License allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute any Apache-licensed product. However, you’re required to follow the terms of the Apache License.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bsd-license&quot;&gt;BSD License&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;category: permissive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, BSD Licenses are mainly used as two variants from the original – the Modified BSD License (3-clause), and the Simplified BSD License/FreeBSD License (2-clause). They are both permissive free software licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BSD License lets you modify and distribute your software’s code in the source or binary format freely as long as you retain a copy of the copyright notice, list of conditions, and disclaimer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eclipse-public-license&quot;&gt;Eclipse Public License&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;category: semi-permissive (copyleft)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can guess, this is a license developed by the Eclipse Foundation. If you modify a component under this license and distribute it in the source code form as part of your program, you must disclose the modified code under the EPL. If you distribute such a program in its object code form, you must state that the source code can be made available upon request, and you must explain how to request the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you redistribute a program with an EPL component, you must include the full license text and the copyrights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPL protects the author of the software from possible lawsuits or damages caused if a company uses their component in a commercial product. It also offers a patent grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mozilla-public-license&quot;&gt;Mozilla Public License&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;category: semi-permissive (copyleft)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mozilla Public License is maintained by the Mozilla project. It is sitting between the Apache license, which does not require modifications to be shared, and the GNU family of licenses, which requires modifications to be shared under a much broader set of circumstances than the MPL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MPL’s “file-level” copyleft is designed to encourage contributors to share modifications they make to your code, while still allowing them to combine the original code with code under other licenses (open or proprietary) with minimal restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;common-development-and-distribution-license&quot;&gt;Common Development and Distribution License&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;category: semi-permissive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDDL is an open-source license published by Oracle. You’re free to reproduce and distribute any original or derivative works of any software licensed under the CDDL. However, you must not remove or make any changes to any copyright, patent, or trademark notices contained in the software. You must also retain any notices of licensing or any descriptive text that attributes any contributor or the initial developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you distribute your software in an executable form (i.e. any form other than source code), you must make the source code available under the CDDL. This source code should include your contributions if they in some way modify the contents of a file containing the original software, or new files that contain parts of the original program. The executable form may be released under the CDDL or any CDDL compatible licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your modifications are in separate and independent files that do not contain the original code, you do not have to release it under the CDDL. Furthermore, you must include a copy of the CDDL with any source code that you distribute. For each modification that you make, you must identify yourself as the modifier by including a notice in your modified files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gnu-lesser-general-public-licenses&quot;&gt;GNU (Lesser) General Public Licenses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;category: copyleft&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GNU’s General Public License is a copyleft license. This means that any software based on any GPL component must be released as open source. It does have a strong community and is quite popular among open-source licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;last-thought&quot;&gt;Last thought&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing and understanding licenses is not easy, luckily there are communities out there to help individual developers. On top of the restriction with licenses, there are extra government regulations (like the EU Cyber Resilience Act) that in putting in extra complications on the responsibility of distributing open-source software. This blog is just covering the basics about OSS licenses, if you are working for a company/ client and are in doubt, please consult legal professionals like company lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What does Python 3.7 End-of-life mean?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You have probably seen everyone has been talking about the end-of-life of Python 3.7 recently. Do you know what does it mean? What happened if you are still using Python 3.7?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-it-mean&quot;&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://devguide.python.org/versions/&quot;&gt;the status of Python versions&lt;/a&gt;, each Python version will have a “lifespan” of its own. From its “birth” - when it got released, to when it will stop getting bug fixes and when we get to the stage that there will no longer be any security bug fixes, that version of Python is considered “dead”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a good idea to upgrade to using more modern Python versions? Absolutely yes! It is never a good idea to use a piece of software that will not receive security fixes - it carries potential risks, if there is a vulnerability found, it will not be fixed and baddies will be able to exploit that vulnerability and potentially do you harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-cant-python-3x-be-maintained-for-ever&quot;&gt;Why can’t Python 3.x be maintained for ever?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very common that software will have a life cycle like Python does. As the number of engineers and resources is limited. It is simply impossible to maintain a piece of software forever. It is even more so for open-source projects when the software is maintained mostly by volunteers. It is better to put resources to improve Python and maintain newer versions of it. That’s why each Python version will have its life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also easier for library maintainer to also maintain their library similarly, supporting only a set of newer versions of the libraries and newer versions of the releases will no longer support old, especially end-of-life versions of Python. In this case, it is possible to publish new features if it does not need to be compatible with Python versions that are very old and are quite different from the newest version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-am-affected&quot;&gt;How I am affected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will probably need to make sure that all your projects are compatible with Python 3.8+ - time to upgrade old and dusty projects, show them some love or make the hard decision to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After upgrading to Python 3.7, check if your dependencies are also upgraded. There are also popular Python libraries, or frameworks that will stop supporting Python 3.7. It will happen again in 3.8 in a year and so on, so it is always a good idea to keep up to date. Ideally, you should be using Python 3.11 right now and is ready to move on to Python 3.12 once it is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a good thing about the Python 3.7 end-of-life, you can now stop testing again Python 3.7 in your CI/CD pipeline. And now you can also use the following cool features that are introduced in Python 3.8 without worrying about breaking backward compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-coolest-features-in-python-38&quot;&gt;What are the coolest features in Python 3.8?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this session with a grain of salt! It is my personal opinion! Python 3.8 has been out for a while so everyone will have their own opinion. Here are my top 3 features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;walrus-operator&quot;&gt;Walrus operator&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very controversial one when it came out! However, now people are starting to get more and more used to it and now after Ptyhon 3.7 is retired you will see them more often. In my opinion,  the most useful way to use it when we have a while loop like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Python&quot;&gt;while content := fetch_from_source(url) is not None:
    do_somthing_with_it(content)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;compare it to the older version which will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Python&quot;&gt;content = fetch_from_source(url)
while content is not None:
    do_somthing_with_it(content)
    content = fetch_from_source(url)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we do not have to write the same line &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;content = fetch_from_source(url)&lt;/code&gt; twice and can keep things consistent easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enforced-positional-argument&quot;&gt;Enforced positional argument&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can enforce arguments to be positional only:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Python&quot;&gt;def my_func(arg1, /, arg2):
    do_something(arg1, arg2)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can only call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;my_func(1, 2)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;my_func(1, arg2=2)&lt;/code&gt; but not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;my_func(arg1=1, arg2=2)&lt;/code&gt; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine this will affect how we use our favourite libraries in the future. As more and more libraries will use enforced positional arguments. Time to double-check their documentation if you are not sure if certain arguments are positional only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;using--in-f-strings&quot;&gt;Using = in f-strings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f-string was introduced in Python 3.6 and it was a game changer in how we print things. It has been more powerful and convenient over time. In Python 3.8, you can now use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; in f-strings like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;f&quot;Account info: {user_name=}&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and it will print out something like “Account info: user_name=user1”. It is extremely useful for debugging and error messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know more about what’s introduced in Python 3.8, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html&quot;&gt;this page at the official documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-my-work-is-still-using-python-37&quot;&gt;What if my work is still using Python 3.7?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, it is crucial and beneficial to be using an updated version of Python. I understand that sometimes there are reasons Python 3.7 is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is for compatibility of a certain piece of software. Look for if a newer version of that piece of software is available. If it is a commercial piece of software, contact the publisher to ask for an update. If it is an open-source piece of software, report the issue and see what you can do to help. I am happily offering my help to any open-source project that may need help in updating the dependencies and removing Python 3.7 from their dependencies (I cannot promise I can solve your problem 100% but I will try)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are required to use Python 3.7 internally, mention the potential concern to the decision makers and explain the importance, like for security reasons, to upgrade to a newer version of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>Humble Data workshop with PyLadies Colombia and PyCon Colombia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first time, also Humble Data’s first time in Latin America. I have heard Colombia is a beautiful country and people are welcoming. However, that’s pretty much all I know about Colombia before going. I was very excited to discover this country and the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;humble-data-at-bogota-with-pyladies&quot;&gt;Humble Data at Bogota with PyLadies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I give myself a mission to bring Humble Data to Latin America. This is the day that my dream becomes reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, Karolina picked me up at my hotel and we went to the event space, it is a nice shared office with good internet. There is a projector and we can use that to give an introduction to all the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A great start for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HumbleData?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HumbleData&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladies_co?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladies_co&lt;/a&gt; workshop &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Un gran comienzo para el taller de &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HumbleData?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HumbleData&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladies_co?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladies_co&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/iIfwcqvsgx&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iIfwcqvsgx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1666588003500695552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 7, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I didn’t speak Spanish, Karolina gave a welcome all the attendees, explain what we do, invite attendees to join the Spanish-speaking Python user community on Discord, and thanked all the sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have a lot of mentors to help, they are really helpful and I am glad that they are there to help. The workshop was a success and went well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HumbleData?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HumbleData&lt;/a&gt; was a great success! Thank you for all the mentors, organiser &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladies_co?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladies_co&lt;/a&gt; and everyone who participated (and thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/europythons?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@europythons&lt;/a&gt; for supporting the event) Mucha gracias 🙏🏻 ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ZpSjLnrTdU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZpSjLnrTdU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1667144341364547585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 9, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the workshop is happening in the mid-week. We decided to have it as two evenings instead of a whole day. This works better for those who need to work in the office. The second day, it is the same day as the Django Girls workshop and it was a busy day for everyone who are involved in both. I am glad that we made it to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later Karolina told me that amount all the participants, there was a teacher who found the workshop material useful and would use them to teach Python. It is amazing! I think it is thanks to Sandrine and her experience being a teacher in the past and being able to create beginner-friendly material to start with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Día 2 del taller de &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HumbleData?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HumbleData&lt;/a&gt; con @pylaides_co y seguimos fuertes &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/HFGx5PlUIV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/HFGx5PlUIV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1666958833648914436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 9, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to thank everyone who makes this event possible. PyLadies Colombia organisers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karobotco&quot;&gt;Karolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nicolefrale&quot;&gt;Nicole&lt;/a&gt; and Lucy who helped find the venue and extra sponsors for the refreshment. All the mentors that help out during the 2 events. And my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://maureira.xyz/&quot;&gt;Cristián Maureira-Fredes&lt;/a&gt; who help with the translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;django-girls-workshop&quot;&gt;Django Girls workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day before PyCon Colombia, there is a Django Girls workshop. The workshop has almost double the participants than Humble Data workshop but I am not surprised as Django Girls are more established. It was our inspiration after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are mentors to help as well, each one of them was given a thank you card handmade by the organisers. It was really sweet. I also like the handmade decoration at the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Me gusta &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoGirlsCo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoGirlsCo&lt;/a&gt; especialmente la decoración &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ipNvIJ4HOB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ipNvIJ4HOB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1666932377011060742?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 8, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met one of the mentors later a the conference and he said some participants ask if there are any workshops to learn Python and data science. I think that’s why we need a Humble Data workshop, the materials covered are different from Django Girls and both can work together and teach more people coding and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pycon-colombia&quot;&gt;PyCon Colombia&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am super excited about PyCon Colombia, it is my first time attending a conference in Latin America. The first day, you get checked in and were given a braceletta - you get one every day and there’s one for each event in conjunction with the conference, I ended up collecting 7 of them (and beating everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Are you excited about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconcolombia&lt;/a&gt; ? Están ustedes emocionados? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FdNoPhnlYG&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FdNoPhnlYG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1667157455313174528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 9, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the keynote speakers are invited from abroad. They are Lukasz Langa, Catherin Devlin, Fabio Pliger, Deb Nicholson and Travis Oliphant. The organisers are being very good hosts and take care of them very well. This is not common for conferences in Europe. I can see the hospitality of Colombia through the organisers. The selection of keynote speakers is also very good, it covers a huge variety of topics and all of them are good speakers. All the keynotes are funny at the same time deliver important messages. I enjoyed all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/baconandcoconut?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@baconandcoconut&lt;/a&gt; is going to tell us how to ask for help as a non-profit at her keynote &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconcolombia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zATsoGqRKT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zATsoGqRKT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1668002933693112324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I am not giving a talk or workshop, I spend most of my time at the conference talking to sponsors and people who don’t mind I cannot speak Spanish. Most of the sponsors are proud Latin American companies. They are just like any startup in Europe, very innovative and hungry for more talents to join them. I also spend a lot of time talking to other ladies at the conference and they are all very nice and tell me where to go for sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Día 2:&lt;br /&gt;La charla de Cheuk Ting Ho (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt;) acerca de como hacer pruebas en Python de una mejor manera me resultó sumamente útil. Espero aplicar estos principios al programar con Python &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FrvcSErWm2&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FrvcSErWm2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Juliana Nieto Cárdenas (@junietoc) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/junietoc/status/1668823721505693707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 14, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every evening at the conference there are activities, on the first day, there is bowling. I was lucky that the organisers invited me. It was at a bowling place that is decorated with a medieval theme. It is very interesting. I had a good time chatting with nice people and discovered that some of my friends are very good at bowling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The speaker dinner &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconcolombia&lt;/a&gt; has really cool decorations - “less fear more faith” - “dream leads us to success” &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hVZZB6QWSV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hVZZB6QWSV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1667687918616432640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day, it was the speaker dinner, I had so much fun sitting with the local organisers and they teach me a lot about their dancing culture. We were so excited that they decided to let me experience it myself - we went dancing after. It was so much fun! I feel like I can dance every day in Colombia. People there dance so well! I get closer to the local speakers and organisers because of that. I am so glad to be welcomed into the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the last day, the social event was drinking at BBC (a Colombia cervezaria chain - think of Starbucks but for beers). Since Travis is only able to join on the last day, I got a chance to chat with him, Juanlita and Mridul and we talked a lot about how to improve the open-source community, especially the scientific programming community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What’s in the coffee break &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconcolombia&lt;/a&gt; ? PyCon Colombia cakes &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Y79yqp2ODR&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Y79yqp2ODR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1667992748627042308?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it a tradition, I also give (half of) a lighting talk in Spanish. This time I read it off my phone. But folks still love it and come to talk to me after about how much they appreciate it… it motivated me to keep learning Spanish. I hope one day I do not have to read it off my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made a lot of connections via the conference. I get to know a lot of people that I already know better because I got to spend more time with them in person at Bogotá. I enjoy the time I spent with them. I hope we will see each other soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Look at all these amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladies_co?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladies_co&lt;/a&gt; ladies at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconcolombia&lt;/a&gt; I am so glad to meet you all ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/HX6Ihhss1z&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/HX6Ihhss1z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1667645573921484801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 10, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-thanks&quot;&gt;Special Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the amazing things mentioned would not be happening without the sponsor of the Humble Data workshop in Bogotá - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.europython-society.org/&quot;&gt;EuroPython Society&lt;/a&gt;. They sponsor my trip to make this connection with the Colombian community and to provide a Spanish workshop to the local folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a chance in the future, come to our annual EuroPython conference. We would love to meet people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you very much for these volunteers to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconcolombia&lt;/a&gt; such an amazing conference &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias por estos voluntarios para hacer de &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconcolombia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconcolombia&lt;/a&gt; una conferencia tan increíble &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IhcRzuJiDE&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IhcRzuJiDE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1668042977552265217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>¿Cómo empezar a dar charlas en conferencias?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/06/how-to-be-speaker/&quot;&gt;Click here for English version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has estado en reuniones y conferencias y quieres ser uno de las personas que exponen, o tienes algunas ideas geniales, descubres algo o tienes una opinión sobre algo que quieres compartir, y te preguntas ¿cómo puedes empezar?. Aquí hay información útil para ti. La información proporcionada se aplicará tanto a eventos presenciales como en línea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cómo-convertirse-en-ponente&quot;&gt;¿Cómo convertirse en ponente?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todos pueden convertirse en ponente, la mejor manera de comenzar es dando una &lt;strong&gt;charla relámpago&lt;/strong&gt; de 5 minutos (o menos) en una conferencia amistosa o un &lt;strong&gt;MeetUp local&lt;/strong&gt;. Es porque no tienes que escribir una propuesta y pasar por el proceso de revisión del llamado de propuestas (CfP), que puede ser difícil para nuevos ponentes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asiste varias veces al evento en el que quieres hablar y ve cómo es el ambiente. ¿La comunidad es acogedora? ¿La audiencia es solidaria? ¿Te sentirías con comodidad dando una charla allí? Busca un evento que tenga un Código de Conducta (CoC) efectivo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;de-qué-puedo-hablar&quot;&gt;¿De qué puedo hablar?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahora, has encontrado la conferencia perfecta o MeetUp como tu escenario de debut. Te puedes preguntar: ¿de qué voy a hablar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depende del evento. Generalmente, las charlas relámpago son más relajadas y se acepta cualquier tema (siempre que sea breve y no viole el CoC). ¡Incluso puedes hablar de tu gato!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para MeetUp locales, creo que la mejor manera es preguntar a los organizadores, ellos conocen la comunidad y las audiencias. Puede preguntarles qué tipo de charla les interesaría. Por lo general, al asistir a la reunión varias veces, es posible que ya obtengas una pista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como regla general, &lt;strong&gt;elige un tema que te apasione&lt;/strong&gt;. A menos que lo especifiquen los organizadores, una charla para principiantes será adecuada para la mayoría de las audiencias (nadie es un experto en todo y, por lo general, habrá más principiantes que expertos en ese tema en la sala). Así que no pienses demasiado ni te presiones para dar una charla muy profunda (solo tienes 30-45 minutos). Piensa en ello como si contaras una historia sobre algo que te importa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si planeabas dar una charla en un MeetUp, a continuación encontrarás algunos consejos para preparar una charla que pueden serte útiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cómo-crear-una-buena-propuesta-cfp-que-te-ayude-a-tu-selección&quot;&gt;¿Cómo crear una buena propuesta (CfP) (que te ayude a tu selección)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¡Así que has intentado hablar frente a una audiencia y te gusta! Quieres obtener la experiencia completa de un ponente y planeas enviar una propuesta a una CfP (Call for Proposal) en una conferencia a la que planeas asistir. ¿Qué harás?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S irealizaste el paso anterior, diste una charla relámpago o una charla en un MeetUp, podrías reutilizar el mismo material. Esto te dará confianza de que el tema funciona ya que ya has dado la charla una vez. Sin embargo, es posible que debas extender o ajustar el material ya que la configuración es diferente esta vez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;qué-escribir-en-una-propuesta&quot;&gt;¿Qué escribir en una propuesta?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para escribir una buena propuesta, primero necesitamos un buen &lt;strong&gt;título&lt;/strong&gt;. Tiene que ser pegadizo ya que es lo primero que ven quienes revisores. Si no se te da bien hacer juegos de palabras, no te preocupes, un título preciso que le dé una idea a quién revisa de lo que vas a hablar también está bien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A continuación, te pueden pedir que proporciones un &lt;strong&gt;resumen&lt;/strong&gt;, que suele ser un párrafo breve de menos de 300-400 caracteres. Esto te permite ampliar el título de tu charla y explicar brevemente de qué se trata. Por lo general, esto se hará público, así que piense en ello como si fuera un asistente a la conferencia, ¿qué te haría venir a esta charla?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Después del resumen, se te puede pedir que proporciones una &lt;strong&gt;descripción&lt;/strong&gt;, esto también será público, pero puedes proporcionar detalles sobre tu charla. Muchas personas que revisan propuestas también juzgarán si esta es una buena charla por la descripción proporcionada. Debes poner el mayor esfuerzo en la descripción. No es solo para quienes revisan, también sería útil cuando tu charla sea seleccionada y tengas que prepararla de verdad. Así es como lo hago:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuando escribo la descripción de mi charla, ya tengo una idea de cómo voy a dar mi charla, voy a hablar de lo primero, luego lo que sigue y cómo terminaría la charla. También explicaré qué &lt;strong&gt;conocimiento se requiere&lt;/strong&gt; para el público y cuáles son los &lt;strong&gt;resultados&lt;/strong&gt; para el público. Además de eso, también escribiré un &lt;strong&gt;bosquejo&lt;/strong&gt; de la charla en la descripción, usando el bosquejo puedo crear fácilmente la estructura para mi conjunto de diapositivas cuando necesito prepararme para dar la charla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;También se te pedirá que proporciones una &lt;strong&gt;biografía&lt;/strong&gt;. Esta es una presentación sobre ti en &lt;strong&gt;tercera persona&lt;/strong&gt;. Esto se hará público, piensa en ello como si quisieras que alguien te presente en el escenario. No es necesario que sea larga, bastará con un párrafo breve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Además del título, resumen y descripción de tu charla, es posible que se te pregunte sobre otras cosas. Estos varían de una conferencia a otra. Una última cosa, si eres un ponente del grupo subrepresentado, indícalo en la sesión extra (solo visible para quienes organizadores o quienes revisan). Algunas conferencias pueden querer asegurar una representación diversa de ponentes y esto les ayudará a decidir al seleccionar las charlas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;convertirse-en-revisora&quot;&gt;Convertirse en revisora&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo mencionado anteriormente son solo cómo lo hago, hay muchas maneras en que puedes escribir una buena propuesta, otra forma de aprender a escribir buenas propuestas es ofrecerte como parte del voluntariado para ser revisores en diferentes conferencias. Allí podrás entender más sobre el proceso de selección de charlas y podrás ver por ti mismo qué es una buena propuesta y qué no lo es.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qué-pasa-si-no-me-seleccionan&quot;&gt;¿Qué pasa si no me seleccionan?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¡Pasa todo el tiempo! Incluso les pasa a ponentes con experiencia, los rechazos pueden ocurrir a veces. No es porque haya escrito una mala propuesta, puede ser que haya muchas presentaciones que sean muy similares a tus temas, puede ser que el tema que elegiste no tenga suficiente interés en esta comunidad en particular, ¡puede ser cualquier cosa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si quieres recibir comentarios sobre tu propuesta, puedes preguntar a los organizadores. No es común que las conferencias brinden comentarios a cada una de las propuestas (¡ya que hay muchas!) y, a veces, es imposible proporcionar comentarios específicos a tu propuesta, incluso si los solicitas. Pero no está de más intentarlo si quieres obtener comentarios sobre tu propuesta, simplemente no espere recibir comentarios cada vez que envíe una propuesta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¿Qué es lo siguiente? &lt;strong&gt;¡Preséntate a otro evento!&lt;/strong&gt; Como mencioné antes, no es porque hayas escrito una mala propuesta. Si tienes comentarios, ¡es genial! Puedes revisar tu propuesta y enviarla a otro evento e intentarlo de nuevo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;qué-pasa-si-me-seleccionan&quot;&gt;¿Qué pasa si me seleccionan?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¡Felicidades! Vas a estar hablando en esta conferencia que te gusta. Debes sentirte con mucha emoción pero con preocupación al mismo tiempo. Respira hondo, por lo general quienes organizan también enviarán una guía de ponentes. Léela bien y verifica lo que tú, como ponente, necesitas preparar en diferentes momentos. A veces, quienes organizan requerirán que se envíen ciertos materiales con anticipación. Consulta el requerimiento técnico para dar una charla y tener todo preparado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cómo-preparar-mis-presentaciones-de-diapositivas&quot;&gt;¿Cómo preparar mis presentaciones de diapositivas?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A continuación, deberás preparar las diapositivas y otros materiales para tu charla. Puedes usar cualquier software para sus diapositivas: algunas personas prefieren Google Slides, otras prefieren reveal.js y otras prefieren pdf. ¡Tú decides! Siempre que funcione técnicamente (consulta la guía de ponentes o con quienes organizan). Para crear el esquema de diapositivas, usa el esquema que escribiste en tu propuesta como guía. Evita poner demasiado en un lado para que se vea demasiado recargado, recuerda, menos es más.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Es posible que quieras anotar algunas notas del ponente para ayudarte mientras das la charla. Evita poner todo el discurso allí, escribirlo como formas puntuales sería una mejor idea. Será más fácil referirse a las notas si olvidaste lo que quieres decir. Es posible que quieras practicar y probar tu discurso con alguien. Puede ser bueno recibir comentarios de alguna persona que sea tu amiga, o mentora, pero sé que no siempre es posible. Creo que practicar y ver si funciona dentro del límite de tiempo sigue siendo una buena preparación, por lo que deberías intentar dar tu charla al menos a un patito de goma como práctica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cómo-hacer-preguntas-a-la-audiencia-durante-tu-charla&quot;&gt;¿Cómo hacer preguntas a la audiencia durante tu charla?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me acostumbré a hacer una pregunta en las primeras diapositivas de mi charla. Esto “despertará a la audiencia” porque les devuelve la atención. Puede ser tan simple como preguntar: “¿Has oído hablar de X? Levanta la mano”. Luego puede comentarlo brevemente (por ejemplo, “Así que no muchos de ustedes lo saben”, “Oh, ya lo saben, pero les voy a decir de todos modos”) y seguir adelante. La clave aquí es &lt;strong&gt;seguir adelante sin importar el resultado&lt;/strong&gt;. El resultado de esta pregunta no debe cambiar lo que va a presentar a continuación.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepara lo que vas a decir en ambos resultados, para que puedas ser real al comentarlo. Esto es mucho mejor que suponer un resultado, porque si resulta lo contrario, te tomará por sorpresa (el público puede ser impredecible) y se siente raro decir algo que no es cierto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;qué-pasa-con-mostrar-código-en-vivo&quot;&gt;¿Qué pasa con mostrar código en vivo?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para algunas presentaciones, puede ser adecuado tener demostraciones de código. Como ponente nuevo, evitaría hacer una demostración en vivo, ya que muchas cosas pueden salir mal en una demostración en vivo. Imagina que hay 100 pares de ojos observándote escribir, el estrés y la presión harán que de repente no puedas escribir y ver correctamente y habrá errores tipográficos que no podrás encontrar y errores que no podrás resolver en el acto. La solución es &lt;strong&gt;grabar la demostración&lt;/strong&gt; (existen varios software de captura de pantalla que son gratuitos) y reproducirla como un video durante la charla. No estoy sugiriendo fingir, pero puedes mostrar abiertamente una demostración grabada en lugar de una vivir una. Está bien y nadie va a pensar que no es una buena charla porque la demostración no es en vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nota: para cualquiera que quiera hacer una demostración LLM en vivo, si sabes que el resultado será impredecible, haz una demostración grabada en lugar de una demostración en vivo para asegurarte de que el contenido generado no viole el CoC. Que sea generado por un modelo entrenado no significa que no seas responsable de lo que se muestra.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;el-gran-día&quot;&gt;El gran día&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durante el día de dar tu charla, si hay sesiones organizadas para hacer un &lt;strong&gt;chequeo técnico&lt;/strong&gt;, por favor házlo. Si no lo hay, puedes preguntar a quienes organizan o a personas del voluntariado responsable de tu sesión cuándo puedes hacer una revisión técnica. Lo último que quieres es tener que resolver problemas técnicos en los primeros minutos de tu charla, esto crea un estrés adicional para la presentación. Si necesitas una salida de audio, por ejemplo, reproducir un video con audio en tu charla, asegúrate de comprobarlo, ya que es más complicado que una charla sin salida de audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recuerda llevar un poco de &lt;strong&gt;agua&lt;/strong&gt; contigo al escenario, por lo general quienes organizan tendrán un poco de agua para quienes exponen, pero en caso de que no la tengan, puedes usar tu botella de agua. ¡No tienes idea de cuántas veces me olvidé y quise tener un poco de agua conmigo mientras estaba en el escenario! Es posible que tengas un tiro seco hacia el final de la charla (tuve una tos fuerte durante mi charla un par de veces), o puedes usar “beber un poco de agua” como un amortiguador si necesita recuperar el hilo de sus pensamientos o necesita vislumbra rápidamente las “notas de ponente” mientras olvidas lo que sigue. Recuerda que el agua es tu mejor aliada mientras estás en el escenario. No dudes en beber agua cuando la necesites, se ve natural en el escenario y te dará tiempo a ti y al público para tomar un descanso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;qué-tal-preguntas-y-respuestas&quot;&gt;¿Qué tal preguntas y respuestas?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¡No siempre tienes que responder preguntas mientras estás en el escenario! Si no se siente con comodidad respondiendo preguntas frente a la audiencia, puedes preparar la charla con tiempo extra,  para que incluya el tiempo de preguntas y respuestas (generalmente los últimos 5 minutos de tu sesión). Infórmale al voluntariado responsable de tu sesión con anticipación que no responderá preguntas en el escenario, sino que pídele a la audiencia que te busque más tarde. Puedes decir que estarás fuera de la sala después de la charla o que estarás en un lugar determinado durante la próxima pausa para el café. Creo que para personas que sea la primera charla, esta puede ser la mejor opción, ya que la pregunta de la audiencia es otra cosa que no sabremos qué esperar y, a veces, puede ser difícil de manejar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si tienes suficiente valentía como para manejar las preguntas, tengo algunos consejos para ti:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Presentar una charla no significa que tengas que saberlo todo, está bien decir “No sé”. Si no tienes seguridad de algo, puedes decir “No sé muy bien si es así”. Trata de no dar información incorrecta.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Si la pregunta no es genuina y te hace sentir con incomodidad, no tienes que responder. Estoy abogando por quien preside la sesión para que tenga el poder de intervenir si las preguntas que se hacen no son genuinas y se debe recordar a las audiencias que deben hacer preguntas genuinas. Pero, si sucede, puedes decir “No entiendo tu pregunta, ¿qué tal si hablamos de esto después afuera?” y pasar a la siguiente pregunta.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dónde-puedo-encontrar-ayuda&quot;&gt;¿Dónde puedo encontrar ayuda?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entonces, después de leer esta publicación, quieres ser ponente, pero aún piensas que sería bueno tener más ayuda. ¿Dónde puedes encontrar ayuda?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como no puedo asesorar a todas las personas, he creado varios programas de tutoría de ponentes con varios eventos. Uno de ellos es &lt;a href=&quot;https://europython.eu&quot;&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt;. Ahora está a cargo un voluntariado y puedes encontrar más recursos sobre cómo convertirte en un buen o buena ponente, es una comunidad que se ayuda entre sí. También puedes solicitar una pareja para que una persona esté a cargo de tu mentoría.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si estás organizando eventos y quieres establecer programas similares, me gustaría mucho ver cómo puedo darte ayuda. Ponte en contacto a través de [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho) o [LinkedIn] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheukting-ho)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to start speaking at conferences?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/06/10/how-to-be-speaker-es/&quot;&gt;Haga clic aquí para la versión en español&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have been to meet-ups and conferences and wish that you are one of the speakers, or you have some great ideas, discover something or have an opinion about something that you wanna share, and you wonder how can you start? Here are some useful information for you. The information provided will apply to both in-person and online events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-become-a-speaker&quot;&gt;How to become a speaker?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone can become a speaker, the best way to start is by giving a 5 mins (or less) &lt;strong&gt;lightning talk&lt;/strong&gt; at a friendly conference or a &lt;strong&gt;local meet-up&lt;/strong&gt;. It is because you don’t have to write a proposal and get through the process of CfP reviews which can be difficult for new speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attend the event that you want to speak at a few times and see what the vibe is like, Is the community welcoming? Is the audience supportive? Would you feel comfortable giving a talk there? Look for an event that has an effective Code of Conduct (CoC) in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-i-speak-about&quot;&gt;What can I speak about?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you have found the perfect conference or meet-up as your debut stage. You may ask: what am I gonna talk about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on the event. Generally, lightning talks are more relaxed and any topics (as long as it’s short and not violating the CoC) are accepted. You can even talk about your cat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For local meet-ups, I think the best way is to ask the organisers, they know the community and the audiences. You may ask them what kind of talk would they be interested in. Usually by attending the meet-up a few times you may already get a clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, &lt;strong&gt;choose a topic that you are passionate about&lt;/strong&gt;. Unless specified by the organisers, a beginner-friendly talk will be suitable for most audiences (no one is an expert in everything and there will usually be more beginners than experts in that topic in the room). So don’t overthink and give yourself pressure to give a very deep talk (you only got 30-45 mins). Think of it as telling a story about a thing that you care about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you planned to give a talk at a meet-up, there are some tips for preparing a talk below that may be useful for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-create-a-great-cfp-that-helps-you-get-selected&quot;&gt;How to create a great CfP (that helps you get selected)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have tried speaking in front of an audience and you like it! You want to get the full speaker experience and are planning to submit a proposal to a CfP (Call for Proposal) at a conference that you are planning to attend. What shall you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have done the previous step - gave a lightning talk or a talk at a meet-up, you could reuse the same material. This will give you confidence that the topic works as you have already given the talk once. However, you may need to extend or adjust the material as the setting is different this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-to-write-in-a-proposal&quot;&gt;What to write in a proposal?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To write a good proposal, first, we need a good &lt;strong&gt;title&lt;/strong&gt;. It needs to be catchy as this is the first thing the reviewers see. If you are not good at making puns, don’t worry, a precise title that gives the reviewer an idea of what you are going to talk about is also ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you may be asked to provide an &lt;strong&gt;abstract&lt;/strong&gt;, this is usually a short paragraph that is less than 300-400 characters. This lets you extend the title of your talk and briefly explain what your talk is about. This will usually be made public so think of it as if you are a conference attendee, what will make you come to this talk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the abstract, you may be asked to provide a &lt;strong&gt;description&lt;/strong&gt;, this will also be public but you can provide details about your talk. A lot of reviewers will also judge if this is a good talk by the description provided. You should put the most effort into the description. It is not only for the reviewers, it would also be useful when your talk is selected and you have to prepare your talk for real. This is how I do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I write the description of my talk, I already have an idea of how I will give my talk, I will talk about what I am going to talk about first, then what next, and how I would end the talk. I will also explain what &lt;strong&gt;knowledge is required&lt;/strong&gt; for the audiences and what are the &lt;strong&gt;takeaways&lt;/strong&gt; for the audiences. On top of that, I will also write an &lt;strong&gt;outline&lt;/strong&gt; of the talk in the description, using the outline I can easily create the structure for my slide deck when I need to prepare to give the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also be asked to give a &lt;strong&gt;bio&lt;/strong&gt;. This is an introduction about you in &lt;strong&gt;3rd person&lt;/strong&gt;. This will be made public, think of it as how you want someone to introduce you on stage. It doesn’t need to be long, a short paragraph will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the title, abstract and description of your talk, you may be asked about other things. These vary from conference to conference. One last thing, if you are a speaker from the under-represented group, state it in the extra session (only visible by the organisers and/ or the reviewers). Some conferences may want to ensure a diverse representation of speakers and this will help them to decide while selecting the talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;becoming-a-reviewer&quot;&gt;Becoming a reviewer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioned above are just how I do it, there are many ways that you can write a good proposal, another way to learn how to write good proposals is to volunteer to be reviewers to different conferences. There you can understand more about the talk selection process and you can see for yourself what is a good proposal and what is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-i-am-not-selected&quot;&gt;What if I am not selected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens all the time! Even for experienced speakers, rejections can happen sometimes. It is not because you have written a bad proposal, it may be there are many submission that is very similar to your topics, it may be the topic you have chosen does not have enough interest in this particular community, it can be anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get feedback on your proposal, you may ask the organisers. It is not common for conferences to give feedback to every single proposal (as there are many!) and sometimes it is impossible to provide specific feedback to your proposal even if you ask. But it is no harm trying if you want to get feedback on your proposal, just don’t expect you will get feedback every time you submitted a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s next? &lt;strong&gt;Submit to another event!&lt;/strong&gt; As I mentioned before, it is not because you have written a bad proposal. If you have got feedback, that’s great! You can review your proposal and submit it to another event and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-i-am-selected&quot;&gt;What if I am selected?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulation! You are going to be speaking at this conference that you like. You must feel excited but worried at the same time. Take a deep breath, usually the organisers will also send over a speaker guide. Give it a good read and check what you, as a speaker, need to prepare at different times. Sometimes organisers will require certain materials to be sent over ahead of time. Check the technical requirement to give you a talk and be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-prepare-my-slide-decks&quot;&gt;How to prepare my slide decks?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you will have to prepare the slides and other materials for your talk. You can use any software for your slides - some people prefer Google Slides, some prefer reveal.js, and some prefer pdf. Up to you! As long as it works technically (check the speaker guide or with the organisers). For creating the slide deck, use the outline that you have written in your proposal to guide you. Avoid putting too much on one side so it looks too busy, remember, less is more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to put down some speaker notes to help yourself while giving the talk. Avoid putting the whole speech there, putting it down as point forms would be a better idea. It will be easier to refer to if you forgot what you want to say. You may want to practice and test your talk with someone. It may be good to get some feedback from a friend or mentor but I know it may not always be possible. I think practice giving it and seeing if it works within the time limit is still a good preparation so you should try giving your talk at least to a rubber duck as a practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-ask-audience-questions-during-your-talk&quot;&gt;How to ask audience questions during your talk?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it a habit to ask one question on the first few slides of my talk. This will “wake the audience” up because it passed the attention back to themselves. It can be as simple as asking: “Have you heard of X, give me a show of hands”. Then you can comment about it briefly (e.g. “So not many of you know”, “Oh you already know, but I am going to tell you anyway”) and move on. The key here is to &lt;strong&gt;move on no matter what the outcome is&lt;/strong&gt;. The outcome of this question should not change what you are going to present next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prepare what you are going to say in both outcomes, so you can be real when you comment on it. This is much better than presuming an outcome because if it turns out the other way you will be thrown off guard (audiences can be unpredictable) and it feels weird saying something that is not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-about-demos&quot;&gt;What about demos?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some presentations, it may be suitable to have code demos. As a new speaker, I would avoid doing a live demo, as many things can go wrong in a live demo. Imagine there are 100 pairs of eyes watching you type, the stress and pressure will make you suddenly unable to type and see properly and there will be typos that you cannot find and bugs that you cannot solve on the spot. The workaround is to &lt;strong&gt;record the demo&lt;/strong&gt; (there is various screen capture software that is free) and play it as a video during the talk - I am not suggesting faking it - but you can openly show a recorded demo instead of a live one. It’s ok and no one is going to think it’s not a good talk because the demo is not live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: for anyone who what to do a live LLM demo, if you know the result is going to be unpredictable, please do a recorded demo instead of a live demo to make sure the content generated does not violate the CoC. It is generated by a trained model does not mean that you are not responsible for what is shown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-big-day&quot;&gt;The big day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day of giving your talk, if there are organised sessions to do a &lt;strong&gt;tech check&lt;/strong&gt;, please do that. If there is not, you may ask the organisers or the volunteer that is responsible for your session when you can do a tech check. The last thing that you want is to have to solve technical problems the first few minutes of your talk, this creates extra stress for presenting. If you need audio output e.g. playing a video with audio in your talk, please make sure to check that as it is more complicated than a talk with no audio output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to bring some &lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt; with you on stage, usually the organisers will have some water for the speakers but in case they don’t have it, you can use your water bottle. You cannot believe how many times I forgot and wish that I have some water with me while on stage! You may have a dry throw towards the end of the talk (I had a bad cough during my talk a few times), or you can use “drinking some water” as a buffer if you need to catch your train of thought or need to quickly glimpse your speaker notes as you forgot what’s next. Remember water is your best ally while being on stage. Don’t be shy to drink water when needed, it looks natural on stage and it will give both you and the audience time to have a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-about-q--a&quot;&gt;How about Q &amp;amp; A?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t always have to take questions while you are on stage! If you don’t feel comfortable answering questions in front of the audience, you can prepare the talk a bit longer so it includes the time for Q&amp;amp;A (usually the last 5 minutes of your session). Let the volunteer who is responsible for your session know in advance that you will not take questions on stage, instead, ask the audience to find you later. You can say you will be outside of the room after your talk or you will be at a certain place during the next coffee break. I think for new speakers, this may be the better option as the audience’s question is another unknown and can be tricky to handle sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are brave enough to handle questions, there are a few tips for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You presented a talk doesn’t mean that you have to know everything, it’s ok to say “I don’t know”. If you are not sure about something, you can say “I am not sure”. Try not to give wrong information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the question asked is not genuine and makes you feel uncomfortable, you don’t have to answer it. I am advocating for the session chair should be given the power to intervene if the questions asked are not genuine and audiences should be reminded about asking genuine questions. But, if it happens, you can say “I don’t get your question, how about we talk about this afterwards outside” and move on to the next question.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-can-i-find-help&quot;&gt;Where can I find help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after reading this post, you want to become a speaker but still think that it would be nice to have more help. Where can you find help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I cannot mentor everyone, I have created various speaker mentorship programs with various events. One of them is &lt;a href=&quot;https://europython.eu&quot;&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt;. This is now run by volunteers and you can find more resources about how to become a good speaker, it is a community that helps each other. You may also apply to get paired with a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are organising events and want to set up similar programs, I am happy to see how I can help. Please get in touch via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheukting-ho&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>JupyterCon 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I participated at a conference in Paris, also the first time participated at JupyterCon. It’s exciting to attend a conference without any expectations. I have made great connections, learn something new and had nice conversations with different people. The most fun part? The venue is a science museum and it matched the theme of the conference perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keynotes-talks-and-tutorials&quot;&gt;Keynotes, Talks and Tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 3 keynotes in total, every day the conference kicks off with a keynote. The first day, it was a keynote by the team from GitHub, I was not too interested so I gave it a pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day, we have Professor Alyssa Goodman giving a talk about the projects related to Glue - a 3 dimensional VR tool that is very useful in astronomy and beyond. She reminds us to not use our computer during her talk and show us why it is important to see things in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Prof. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlyssaAGoodman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@AlyssaAGoodman&lt;/a&gt; is giving a keynote about Glue - extra point if you keep your laptop closed while listening &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JupyterCon2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JupyterCon2023&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5rzg6PiLw7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/5rzg6PiLw7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #JupyterCon (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1656558336672768001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day, we have Nobel prize winner Paul Romer giving his “lecture” style keynote - there were equations, quite a lot of them (considered you have been warned). It was very tough for me to attend a lecture at 9 in the morning during my university years and listening to his keynote at 9 am reminded me of this. Nether the less, he has delivered a very good message and idea - make Jupyter Notebook an interactive pdf by adding the SHA sign feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Signing is not enough, you need infa to publish keys, and trust people. or keys can be made in active. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/1pswL6fhKS&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/1pswL6fhKS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; JupyterCon 2023 (@JupyterCon) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon/status/1656932532611432451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 12, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the keynotes, I didn’t go to many talks, there are all recorded and I was carried away with chatting with people a lot of times. There are a few that I enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the talks was by Jeremy, the maintainer of JupyterLite. It inspires me to try using it in workshops but this brings me to finding a bug during the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JupyterCon2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JupyterCon2023&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jtpio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jtpio&lt;/a&gt; is talking about Jupyter Lite &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UI2gXvt81G&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/UI2gXvt81G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #JupyterCon (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1656217032709353474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 10, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one is by Pavithra, who is the developer advocate of QuantSight, she is so sweet and it’s nice to see her in person. And she delivers her talk very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pavithraes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pavithraes&lt;/a&gt; is taking about community backed OSS &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JupyterCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bHO93VKU0e&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/bHO93VKU0e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #JupyterCon (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1657001924690862083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 12, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also gave a talk about memory profiling on Jupyter, I was given the room that is used for the keynote so it is only 20% full - I think there may be around 80 people there. I also gave too many lighting talks at the conference… I hope the competition will be keener next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also went for one tutorial (actually half) about security in Jupyter - I think it is interesting but when it get to the hands-on exercise part, I ran for some fresh air in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hall-track-and-social-event&quot;&gt;Hall Track and Social event&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a lot of sponsors at the venue, including Anaconda - our booth is a good place to meet colleagues and chat with people. It is a small booth and is at the back next to the NumFocus booth so it is not busy a lot of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also talked to other sponsors and see if they are interested to sponsor other conferences that I organised. There’s one interesting booth with a Robot that can talk to you - it is connected to ChatGPT so it is fun to interact with it. After interacting with it for a while I found it quite adorable and now I want a robot too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Robot selfie with Pepper at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JupyterCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/8bQw7FC7p8&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/8bQw7FC7p8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #JupyterCon (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1656601789079212032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a PyLadies booth on the top floor, I often go there to chat with my friends who organise PyLadies Paris and Berlin. It is also a gathering place for PyLadies Lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Having a great time at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; with my fellow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyLadiesParis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyLadiesParis&lt;/a&gt; friends. 🥳 If you are attending the conference make sure to visit us today at our booth for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladies?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladies&lt;/a&gt; lunch! 🍛🥗 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Diversity?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Diversity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WomenInSTEM?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#WomenInSTEM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/WomenInTech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#WomenInTech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/J1FbpHZW7B&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/J1FbpHZW7B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Maren Westermann (@MarenWestermann) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarenWestermann/status/1656959135693324292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 12, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also sometimes take calls at the side ally of the hallway, it is mostly quiet - and even quieter than the quiet room sometimes (I am not supposed to take calls in the quiet room anyway) cause people were chatting in the quiet room occasionally - I think the organisers need to remind people not to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day, we have a poster session before the reception (there are food and drinks there already) and I like how it is organised, it encourages people to go see the poster presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It was great to meet everyone at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; reception tonight!&lt;br /&gt;With a great view of La Géode of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/citedessciences?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@citedessciences&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/b0rUmgezpG&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/b0rUmgezpG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sylvain Corlay (@SylvainCorlay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SylvainCorlay/status/1656775695786209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the poster session, it is the drink reception and the food is absolutely amazing. It is in the museum space and there were some creative ways of presenting the food - one canopy dish looks like a fruit that got picked from a plant; there’s a chocolate egg that was cracked with a hammer before serving… I think it’s one of my favourite social events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-i-met&quot;&gt;People I met&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually what makes me think the trip is worthwhile is because of all the people that I met and connected with. It’s great to meet up with old friends and make some new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so glad to be able to have a chat with Carol again! She is so so so kind and inspiring and sometimes I feel like there’s a queue of people wanting to talk to her. I am glad to be able to “get a seat” and she is very warm and kind and has given me good advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Having a bunch of great conversations &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JupyterCon2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JupyterCon2023&lt;/a&gt;. Really great to see so many folks and cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Carol Willing (@WillingCarol) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WillingCarol/status/1656388767270285314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 10, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, I have a friend that I have not met in a while - Sandrine who founded Humble Data with me is also organising the conference, she is super busy and we didn’t get much time to hang out but we had a good chat during the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other conference friends that I have not met for a while are Vishal and Tereza, together with Noa we went for dinner one evening and it was a very enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It was a very nice dinner with Noa, Vishal and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/terezaif?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@terezaif&lt;/a&gt; We eat a lot and laugh a lot - especially when the dessert arrived… It’s a nice &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JupyterCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; memory &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/U0xdStInls&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/U0xdStInls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #JupyterCon (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1656643936121679873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also great to chat with Pravitha from QuantSight and Sarah who used to work in the Alan Turing Institute. She is also leading the project Jupyter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had dinner with the PyLadies Organisers, folks in the Scikit Learn team, Matt - code maintainer of Dask and Paul - the developer advocate of Capital One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more, I met Stephannie, a speaker who’s from Colombia, I got a handmade Jupyter ball from her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;💥 Had a blast at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to all the organizers and attendees 🤗 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qqhWCfcbK3&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qqhWCfcbK3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Stephannie Jimenez (@StephannieJime2) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StephannieJime2/status/1657345717218820097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 13, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sprints&quot;&gt;Sprints&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was trying to use JupyterLite, I found out that some magics do not work as it does in JupyterLab. It brings me down a rabbit hole of looking at the iPython kernel code and JupyterLite code. Jeremy showed me how to see the message getting sent from the Jupyter frontend to the kernel at JupyterLab and how it is replicated in JupyterLite. It is fascinating. I am not sure I will be able to find the problem and fix it but it is a study opportunity for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Self organising sprints at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CarrNum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@CarrNum&lt;/a&gt; ! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/N1mmvojaIz&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/N1mmvojaIz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; JupyterCon 2023 (@JupyterCon) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon/status/1657300436737568774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 13, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realised that Jeremy is very kind and helpful. A few people are using JupyterLite and needing his help, he just keeps helping people and was so busy at the sprint. I didn’t work on any Scikit Learn issues but the person next to me did, he is a new contributor and Guillaume was so patient and give him a one-to-one mentored sprints - walking through all the basics of open-source contribution principles. I wish I can invite them both to the mentored sprint in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a good time (I think I said that a lot going to Python community conferences) and I think the conference is a success. I made some good connections in the community and learnt some new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you the organizing team of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JupyterCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JupyterCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JupyterCon2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JupyterCon2023&lt;/a&gt; I really like this conference and thank you for making it happened ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gDMuaFaH9S&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gDMuaFaH9S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #JupyterCon (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1657044430111555586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 12, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small episode when I try to get my train home - it was cancelled and I had to sneak on the previous one, I was so scared that I will not be able to get home and got sucked into Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyCon US 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have some time to put my thought together and report back everything that happens in PyCon US. It’s a huge conference and almost everyone I know is there. It is so easy to be overwhelmed by the conference and time just passes very quickly. I always wish I could stay till the very end of the sprint and it will never end but in reality, we all need to go home and rest. Especially those who worked so hard to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; owes so much to the generous people who volunteered this year. You gave out t-shirts, monitored rooms, moved tables, and so many other things. Thank you, thank you, thank you! You&amp;#39;re the absolute best.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tutorial-days&quot;&gt;Tutorial Days&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the tight schedule of PyCon DE and PyCon US overlaps, I missed the first day of the tutorials. So the first thing that I do at the conference was to give my tutorial about Numba. I was told that there are 44 people registered and 40 people were attending. I am glad that compare to last year people are more engaging in my tutorial and there are really good interactions. There are good questions from the audience, and people come and talk to me at the end of the workshop. I have made a few good connections because of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I go around and say hi to all the people that I have not seen for a while. It is so good to catch up with them. I also went to have coffee with my team, and after that, we all go back to the booth briefing by our colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sophiamyang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@sophiamyang&lt;/a&gt; is doing a demo at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt; booth! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uE4uMO1BBY&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uE4uMO1BBY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1649492614196994054?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 21, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we have the opening party at the expo hall and everyone got a chance to talk to everyone at the booth. We have a very good vibe at our booth and people are coming to talk to us and my colleague is giving a presentation. I also get a chance to talk to the folks at the community booth. Including my friends from APAC who are at the PyCon APAC booth. I also donated to the PyLadies and got a few t-shirts there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conference-days---friday&quot;&gt;Conference days - Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference days are streaming busy for me as I have to give a talk and also host the lightning talks. I have to also be in the reimbursement room to help folks who are reimbursing their travel grants and honorary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Are you ready for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; ? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/p0XqU00UT5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/p0XqU00UT5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1649427864981307393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 21, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before anything started, we have the opening and Mariatta is the sweetest conference chair ever. She introduced all the keynote speakers with a personal touch and she makes sure everyone that helped out are appreciated. With her effort, she makes the conference fun for everyone - including a point-based system for being involved in the conference and contributing to open-source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nedbat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@nedbat&lt;/a&gt; is the first keynote speaker of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; it was a very touching introduction &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ggiRTWWwaP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ggiRTWWwaP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1649438870751043584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 21, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the first keynote by Ned. It explains in a developer’s language how to interact with a human. It is funny, inspirational and useful for all of us. When I am home I show it to my partner and he loves it as well. A bit more about Ned, he is also a very good teacher in teaching us how to juggle during the open spaces and the sprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On Mastodon: A juggling open-space at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qo8p4HQueN&quot;&gt;https://t.co/qo8p4HQueN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ned Batchelder (@nedbat) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/1649831089358389248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 22, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I give my talk in the evening, I only managed to attend one talk in person, that was Zac’s talk. I know Zac is a very good teacher and he explains something very complicated - structured concurrency - in a way that I can understand. I am so glad that I will be able to spend some time working with him in the sprints later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Zac is one of the Pythonistas that I have a lot of respect. Very good talk about structured concurrency at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/8ZHToE5iR9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/8ZHToE5iR9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1649541713810059264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 21, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is nerve-wracking to give a talk at PyCon US in a room with around 300 people also there will be many experts in the field present. The audience included Larry Hastings, someone who is an absolute expert on my talk topic. Another expert that is present was Mike Müller, who is a Python trainer. They all give me valuable feedback on how I can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; organizers (hi &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@loooorenanicole&lt;/a&gt; 🤣) prepping for day 2 lightning talks! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OnYG7Q9GIx&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/OnYG7Q9GIx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Chris Williams 🐍 (@mistwire) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mistwire/status/1649776654909317120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 22, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my talk, I have to run for the lightning talk. Behind the scene, we have to mark down all the signups on the board and then Lorena and I will select the talks based on the title that they give us. This is how it work in the past few years in PyCon US, but it is very difficult to choose the talk just based on the titles. I have seen many different ways of doing the lighting talks, I think there needs to be a balance of not being too rigid but also a certain amount of fairness. Luckily Lorena is very experienced and we ended up with a variety of topics and some of the speakers are first-time attendees to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Masked Lightning Talk Speaker &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; (@ Salt Palace Convention Ballroom in Salt Lake City, UT) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2fKxoMZ6dl&quot;&gt;https://t.co/2fKxoMZ6dl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pzRaWAxGdH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/pzRaWAxGdH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Takanori Suzuki (@takanory) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/takanory/status/1649571265437466626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 22, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lightning talks, I got a chance to hang out with the folks in PyCon APAC, I got to try out my (not very good) Japanese skills with the folks from Japan. They are all very nice and they could be perceived as a bit shy due to the language barrier but I like talking to them when we have warmed up a bit. I am also glad to be meeting up with Sammy, the organiser from Hong Kong and Alysson from the Philippines. Iqbal had some suggestions for the APAC communities and I am glad that I am welcome into the discussion. We also went to the PyParty afterwards but I was not enjoying it too much as it was very crowded and noisy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The Python Asia community get together dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS2023&lt;/a&gt; in Salt Lake City. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/terapyon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@terapyon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/selina787b?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@selina787b&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/darjeelingt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@darjeelingt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/achimnol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@achimnol&lt;/a&gt; and please tag the rest that I missed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/8zFgHjkqnK&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/8zFgHjkqnK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon Asia @pyconasia@mtd.pythonasia.org (@pyconapac) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconapac/status/1649773365991985153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 22, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conference-days---saturday&quot;&gt;Conference days - Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lightning talk session at 8 am is very challenging - some speakers were missing and there were not a lot of people in the audience. Lucky for me that my jetlag tends to make me wake up very early so I have no problem being there early. Maybe we should do Yoga or jogging in the morning next year instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Relax and restore yourself at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; 2023 with a yoga session. It starts in 30 minutes at 6:00pm MT! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qb8FJpL3Xm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qb8FJpL3Xm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon US (@pycon) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycon/status/1649918529506779145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 22, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are panel sessions from the steering council and the D&amp;amp;I committee. I am glad to see that there are more attendees to the DEI panel than last year and everyone at the panel talks about the time they spend just to come to PyCon US, I was touched. I do believe that the Python community should be all connected and we should support each other no matter where you are. We also need a diverse representation of members and leadership in the community. So if you are organising Python-related events or contributing to Python OSS, please &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/psf/membership/&quot;&gt;self-certify as a managing or contributing member&lt;/a&gt; - I am sure you have already contributed more than 5 hours per month and you are qualified. You can also consider donating to become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/psf/membership/&quot;&gt;supporting member &lt;/a&gt;. Both the memberships mentioned above have voting rights and you can help pick the future leaders in the community (or become one yourself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skip the morning keynote to help out in the reimbursement session. My job is to welcome people and check them in. It was quiet as most people are in the keynote session. But I got to speak to a few folks and I am glad that we got to support many people with diverse backgrounds to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During lunchtime, the room for reimbursement was transformed into the PSF lunch. I think it’s a good setting and Phyllis, one of the PSF staff, handles everything so well. There are many familiar faces there including all the PSF staff and the fundamental contributors to the PSF, including Guido himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get to stay at lunch for long as we have the mentored sprints and I need to be there to help out, Tania lead organising it for a few years now and it was always a success. It’s an event that is designed for folks who are new to sprint and hopefully, they will learn what is a sprint so they can feel more comfortable joining the sprint - or if they missed the sprint this year they will think of staying for it next year. Of cause, Zac is there and he always got many people sitting at his table. Unfortunately, he said Hypothesis is running out of good beginner issues at the moment for people to work on, nevertheless, I have seen many people learning to use Hypothesis and contributing to the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day also ended with a lightning talk session, but the schedule is super tight as Lorena and I are both going to the PyLadies Auction, she is also one of the hosts at the Auction. The PyLadies Auction was super fun as always. This year I got to witness some creative (or crazy) items being Auction off - like Russell doing Tim Tam Slam, a random pen left on the projector, a vinyl recording that is made by the core devs and a PSF-owned MacBook Air with Python design laser edged on it. I have also donated something - two neckties that were given to me by Sammy, I donated them on his behalf. Afterwards, I connect with one of the kind people that win the auction of the tie and he said it was his first time joining PyCon US and the PyLadies Auction. I am so happy that he was having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;re almost starting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pyladies?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Pyladies&lt;/a&gt; auction. it will be a fun night! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here the team of volunteers ready for the event. 💪🏽💜🐍🐍&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladies?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS2023&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/CuZokUYMDN&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/CuZokUYMDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Denny Perez (@dennyperez18) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dennyperez18/status/1649933650278989825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conference-days---sunday&quot;&gt;Conference days - Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday kicks off with community announcements - there are so many events coming up in the Python community. Then we have regular lighting talks and then the keynote by Margaret Mitchell, who gave a very good perspective of why we need to talk about ethics in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Check out our tools for Ethics in AI at &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/eZLpK4y19a&quot;&gt;https://t.co/eZLpK4y19a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@mmitchell_ai&lt;/a&gt; on how you might start looking into some datasets yourself. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/aq661j8Co7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/aq661j8Co7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Deb 💗 💜 💙 #BLM #StopAAPIHate 🐌 (@baconandcoconut) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/baconandcoconut/status/1650165817869467650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mostly helping out in the reimbursement room during the job fair, but while I ran around fetching coffee I managed to say hi to Peter our CEO, whom I had known as a phenomenal community member before I join Anaconda. Today we have PyLadies Lunch, as always it is good to be in the same room with a lot of amazing ladies, Selina from Japan give a speach about what she had achieve but she didn’t forget to promote for PyCon APAC. There are also ladies from Argintina, they gave a touching speach even though they have to use they phone to help translating. It’s a great experience. The whole afternoon I was very tired but at the same time, I was looking forward to Carol’s keynote. Therefore I didn’t go back to the hotel afraid I would have missed it, instead I was walking around the venue chatting with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol’s keynote was very heartwarming, she talked about her story, and how we are connecting and building a community. It gave me some insight into our work in the community. Following Carol’s keynote, we have Deb gave a talk about the updates from the PSF and the presentation of the awards. Right after, Guido talked about &lt;del&gt;how to use AI to make Python faster&lt;/del&gt; the history of PyCon in the last 20 years. As he put it - Grandpa is telling stories when he was young. He talked about all the fun things when PyCon when it’s in its early stages. For one time he ordered the same sandwich for every day of the conference. Mariatta gave a very sweet closing, she cries to the Savage Garden music and made a credit video to thank everyone that has contributed to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Proof that it did happen: Full room of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; 2023 in Salt Lake City at 5 PM Sunday during conference closing, celebrating 20 years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 💖 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3zeXJAwhds&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/3zeXJAwhds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mariatta 🤦 (@mariatta) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1650558109453017090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 24, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the closing, I hosted an open space session to talk about the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act&quot;&gt;Cyber Relience Act in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. Deb, Jannis and Cheng join me and we talked about the newest development of it. Deb told us she is in touch with a lot of experts in Europe about the issue. This gives me confidence that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-eus-proposed-cra-law-may-have.html&quot;&gt;the PSF is on the case&lt;/a&gt; but as a developer working in Europe we also need to be aware of the issue and voice out our opinion when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprints are the last thing that happened at PyCon US but it’s one of my favourite times at the conference. I got a chance to work with Zac on Hypothesis. In the meantime, I can ask Jannis about conda and Russell about Beeware. I also get a chance to chat with Carol and Kattni. The best break from coding at the sprint was to go and have lunch and an ice-cream selfie with Mariatta, Geogi and Zac. (I think Zac had too much ice cream throughout the sprint as he was invited to go with various groups) Every time we hang out, we have a good idea for Mariatta for the conference next year, I think if we have more ice cream with Maritta the conference next year would have been planned already. Let’s look forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Never too late to post our &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/icecreamselfie?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#icecreamselfie&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mariatta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@mariatta&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; and Zac to get 1 point &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycon&lt;/a&gt; US. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Uc3ItPOBcM&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Uc3ItPOBcM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; georgically (@georgically1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/georgically1/status/1651651571434893313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 27, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before heading home, I got a chance to hang out with Jodie from Jet Brain, we have met multiple times in the past but this is the first time we have had a long chat together. It was really pleasant to get to know her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Good bye SLC and thank you for the great &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; Thank you so much for everyone I met, you all are amazing and I have learnt so much. I am glad to be traveling with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/t_redactyl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@t_redactyl&lt;/a&gt; back to Europe as well ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wCqKFP06rA&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wCqKFP06rA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1651383892744589313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 27, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it was a very fulfilling trip. Going to PyCon US is always a heartwarming experience. Over the years many people are putting efforts to make sure everyone can have a good time at the conference and every one is appreciated no matter what contribution they had to the community and Python and open-source software. I have learnt so much and thank you for the community that provides me with the energy to keep moving forward and all my friends that - from you I found good companionship and support throughout my career. THANK YOU ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Met Mariia from Ukraine in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; she gave me a badge of her country’s flag, I gave her a badge that reads “Hong Kong” - we are all connected no matter where you are from &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3R21v4xl7B&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/3R21v4xl7B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1651258511697870850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 26, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>PyConDE and PyData Berlin 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;PyCon DE has been joining hands with PyData Berlin since 2019 and it has grown to a conference that is as big as EuroPython over the past years. It’s an event that is too hard to miss and of cause, I am back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-day&quot;&gt;First Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So many attendees at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConDE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/xUF3yvo8nn&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/xUF3yvo8nn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUS (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1647873088971735040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, registration started at 8:30 am, 1.5 hours before the opening sessions. To avoid the huge queue that happened last year, I arrived early to get my badge. Not soon after, the venue is already packed with conference attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Whole &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; team for the opening 🙌🏻 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/D5rgFlupEk&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/D5rgFlupEk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUS (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1647875327115374592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, there are 1700+ attendees and it reached the maximum capacity. The event is hybrid and there will be online participation, including video streaming and asking questions online via Slido and Discord server to join. When asked how are the first-time attendees, there are 80-90% of people show that they are first-timers. It has been a trend that most attendees are new since the conference came back to the Berlin venue last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Attending conference by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; for the first time 🚀 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organization is super. I am looking forward for interesting talks and exciting insights about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/datascience?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#datascience&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/data?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConDe?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConDe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyDataBerlin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyDataBerlin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3TkNnRgYMr&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/3TkNnRgYMr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sofya Guseva (@SofyaGuseva_) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SofyaGuseva_/status/1647882261209964545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another highlight is that this year European Union is also supporting the conference. I think it is not common that, there are government organisations that have a presence at a tech conference. I like seeing that since open-source technology would be affected by government policies and we need more communication because of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leah from NumFocus is also here to support PyData Berlin. Every year NumFocus would have a booth at eh conference. Another thing I like about this conference is there is a lot of involvement in PyLadies events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyLadies?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyLadies&lt;/a&gt; and friends at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConDE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; be aware of these events &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uOFaheSxUU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uOFaheSxUU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUS (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1647883788221808641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I mostly talk to people at the booths, people that I know and organisers. I also spend some time in the quiet room to prepare my talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we have our first keynote. In the first part, she talks about using Ren’Py for game development. Then she talked about her journey in Machine Learning at Telco. Next is her experience at FinTach. Last, she talked about her role at Electric which takes care of cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;First keynote of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConDE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; by Susan Shu Chang about her rich background in multiple industries using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/x18uyaR0G4&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/x18uyaR0G4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUS (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1647932682225975301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a coffee break. The talk before mine is by Emeli about continuous testing of the machine learning model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that it was my talk, the room was full and I asked the capacity of the room it was around 100. Unfortunately, I cannot find any pictures on Twitter - people are very serious and take notes during the talk. Generally, it was a very engaging audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my talk, Luis from Stack Builder come talked to me and ask how his company can help contribute to our projects as Anaconda. They are interested in packaging so I said feedback on conda would be nice. We connected on LinkedIn and will follow up if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I head back to my hotel to chill and attend Zoom meetings. When the meetings are done. I had to meet up with others at one Bavaria restaurant nearby. The organising team, the SciKit-lean team and Ines - founder of explosion and creator of spaCy were there. I also catch up with my old friend Alejandro who used to be living in London and had just recently moved to Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There were more of us but these are the last ones still there. It was delightful having a nice conversation with friends - old and new at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConDE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/l6jPJEYxPm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/l6jPJEYxPm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUS (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1648219883534970880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-day&quot;&gt;Second Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second data kick-started with a keynote by Noa - in which she talked about her perspective on managing a data team. It’s refreshing to have a talk that is about career development but not technical things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;First keynote of day 2 - about managing data science team IRL - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConDE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/8mVVE9ezIs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/8mVVE9ezIs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUS (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1648224198442057729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the rest of the day is between the hall tract and a quiet room for preparing for PyCon US. I do love both conferences but if there are not happening back to back it would have been much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am not working, I spent a lot of time socialising in the hallway. Especially when my friend Autur arrived. Even though I was busy, I managed to attend Valerio’s talk about PyScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leriomaggio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@leriomaggio&lt;/a&gt; is talking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyscript_dev&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConDE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pcHQqssGPy&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/pcHQqssGPy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUS (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1648252613836636160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I volunteered to host the Lighting Talks with Miro, a very talented friend who is a polyglot and also the keynote speaker the next day. We have prepared some tricky Python questions to ask the audience while the talks are switching. It was fun and there were some awesome lightning talks as well. I also gave a lightning talk about CRA - I am raising awareness of it because I think it will be GDPR 2.0 and why there aren’t more developers talking about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/condaforge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@condaforge&lt;/a&gt; lighting talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConDE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/YpU9dxNLVA&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/YpU9dxNLVA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUS (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1648355062853271557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening it was the social party sponsored by Octopus, everything becomes pink and there are Octopus everywhere in the hall. There were refreshments and doughnuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the social event, we went out for one last drink. At our table, there were a few newcomers to the conference and it seems they are having a good time. My friend Martin and Martin (yes there are two of them) and I was giving them tips on how to make the best use of the conference to meet people who are learning more Python. I love seeing new people at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-missed-the-third-day-&quot;&gt;I missed the Third Day :(&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have to give the third day of PyCon DE a miss because it is the travel day to PyCon US. There are some attendees and friends of mine who are also going to PyCon US on the same flight. The journey is so much more enjoyable (or more tolerable depending on how you look at it) when you have friends travelling together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my friend Martin sent me a picture of PyCon DE on day 3. I was mentioned at Jürgen’s talk. I feel so honoured. Everyone’s very kind to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jugmac00?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jugmac00&lt;/a&gt; for mentioning me at his talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConDE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConDE&lt;/a&gt;! I was on my way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUS&lt;/a&gt; but I will definitely watch it later ❤️ and yes I love Tox &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LnlRixVKTV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LnlRixVKTV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUS (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1649038693083095042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 20, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot agree with this tweet more, PyCon DE is an awesome conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There&amp;#39;s SO many reasons why &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConDE&lt;/a&gt; is a GREAT conference. On top of the community, vegan veggie delicious catering, sustainable setup, child-care, gender neutral bathrooms, inclusive language, riddles to integrate people, diverse topics &amp;amp; speakers... so much 🥰 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vsKzeIMAgH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/vsKzeIMAgH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Paloma Oliveira (@pcultural) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pcultural/status/1649104131720724486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 20, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>PyCon Limerick 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I have been to Limerick for PyCon. It was supposed to come back after the pandemic last year but unfortunately, last year they have to cancel the event. So what’s the rebooting of the conference this year be like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;PyCon Limerick! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIe?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConLimerick?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConLimerick&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SnLxiJVJO9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/SnLxiJVJO9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Python Ireland (@PythonIreland) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PythonIreland/status/1639650345453342720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 25, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;morning&quot;&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived the day before and stay in the hotel where the conference is happening. In the morning, I met the organisers at the breakfast table. They have problems with some speakers who cannot make it to Limerick so there will be some remote talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a slow start in the morning, there’s no official opening so I arrived at the registration before the first talk started. I was glad to meet some of my friends in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Glad to see some familiar faces &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConLimerick?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConLimerick&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PythonIreland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PythonIreland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JR8YQ9PvYE&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JR8YQ9PvYE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1639559420769083393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 25, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended a talk about hyper-modernising Python code, this is the first time I heard about this term but basically, that summarises the modern standard of Python projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Morning talk time at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConLimerick?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConLimerick&lt;/a&gt; about Hyper-modernising Python code base &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/GXzR4Q4Z54&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/GXzR4Q4Z54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1639561531703558147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 25, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I tried a remote talk about managing the open-source communities. I got some inspiration from it, especially the champion program part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Remote talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConLimerick?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConLimerick&lt;/a&gt; about managing open source communities &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Sf2YNfuOxv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Sf2YNfuOxv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1639570852428537856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 25, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a talk about the security breach of some big companies. From what they did wrong we learnt how to better protect ourselves and our projects. The main take away, don’t hardcore any secrets from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have a talk about how to think like a hacker to avoid hackers at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConLimerick?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConLimerick&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PythonIreland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PythonIreland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/36GFKkSJBU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/36GFKkSJBU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1639597630832492544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 25, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lunch, we are on our own, but most of us take the advantage of the hotel restaurant downstairs. The organisers book several tables for us in advance as the restaurant gets quite busy later for the ruby game. It’s nice to be able to chat with folks from the conference at the lunch tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;afternoon&quot;&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right after lunch is my talk. I was given 40 mins for the talk but seriously I do not have that much to say. So in the end it ended up as a discussion about what tricks we do to test things better. Everyone shared their ideas. I am glad that it ended up becoming an interesting session because of the enthusiasm of the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can watch my talk here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pxabsoecl5E&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a talk about real-time analytics. To be honest I was too tired to focus on the talk after many interesting talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Real time ML analytics talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConLimerick?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConLimerick&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PythonIreland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PythonIreland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/AJWuYu77ZH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/AJWuYu77ZH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1639639559024541698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 25, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, since I was too tired to listen to more talks, I spent some time catching up with friends and talking to some organisers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SubAFQopHEU&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a flight to catch so I leave after the last talk got wrapped up. All in all, it was a small but nice conference. All the attendees are very passionate about the topics and are very engaging.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyCascade 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;PyCascade is not as huge in number as other conferences, but there’s something special about it. Let’s find out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day I arrived, it is the day before the conference. One of the sponsors, Microsoft, was so nice to host the pre-conference social for all the attendees. It also doubles as an early check-in for the conference. I was glad that I check-in early as the proof of vaccination is required to be within a year… as someone from the UK and not in a vulnerable group, I was not offered a vaccination against COVID since 2021. (And going private was not an option last time I checked). So the only option is to get a certified RAPID test, which another British speaker and I managed to get from a nearby hotel (they sent everyone there, business must be good for them that day lol). Later one of the organisers explained why they have that policy in place, I think it’s fair, for me it is more like a cultural shock. In the UK most of us already forgot the impact of COVID on people, which I don’t know if it’s a good thing or not. We remained masked for most of the conference as well, which is fine by me, I spent a week in Japan before so it’s natural for me to wear a mask all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;behind the scenes setup the night before PyCascades 2023 Conference 👋 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4nH3TYRXol&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/4nH3TYRXol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thx for joining us at PyCascades 2023!!!! 🥳🎊🍃🌄 (@pycascades) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades/status/1636910186005774336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the social we have Mexican food, for me, it tastes good. I had a good chat with a few of the attendees. Some celebrities in the community, such as Guido, are also among the attendees. Since it is not the first time I met Guido at Python conferences so I was not too surprised. Not the same case for some attendees who have attended a Python conference in the US for the first time, they usually go up to him and greet him. Guido said it is funny that everyone knows him but he does not know everybody, I agree that is it quite an awkward feeling being famous. But he treats everyone equally and seems he has not had much trouble blending in after a while. We even have a nice discussion about quantum computers and other sci-fi-like topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived on time for the conference on the first day. There is coffee ready for the attendees. The conference offered refreshments during breaks but for lunch, we have to go out to have it on our own, which is not a problem as we form lunch outing groups on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Coffee and registration ready at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycascades&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/86yur9OMCL&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/86yur9OMCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1637123583225864192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to attend most of the talk on day 1, there are a few interesting talks in the morning. First, we have a very nice talk about Python syntactic sugar by Brett Cannon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;First talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycascades&lt;/a&gt; is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brettsky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@brettsky&lt;/a&gt; about Python syntactic sugars 🍬 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Oo0duHqrKC&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Oo0duHqrKC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1637129112853573636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have Ricky talk about the inner working of CPython, which is a very beginner-friendly talk for people who are interested in what happened to their Python code when executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After the break, there’s more talks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycascades&lt;/a&gt; Here’s one by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/coolandsmartrr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@coolandsmartrr&lt;/a&gt; about the inner working of Python code &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2r4uwjRxvv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/2r4uwjRxvv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1637160159301517313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCascade also offers silence viewing (with caption) at another theatre, taking advantage of the fact that all the talks are live-streamed for remote participants. I like the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycascades&lt;/a&gt; support silence viewing 🤫 here is the talk by Sarah Kaiser about Spotless Development Environment &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/0oWmJU6RRL&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/0oWmJU6RRL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1637206266547191808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lunch, I follow Mariatta and her family to have Malaysian food. The Hainan chicken was really good. As there’s a huge Asia population in Vancouver the Asian food there seems better than what London has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I met Denny and her husband Andres, my friends who helped out at Pyjamas. I am so glad to meet them in person finally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We had this excellent shot at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycascades&lt;/a&gt; photo booth today.😊 &lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m so excited to network in person with these great people from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Python&lt;/a&gt; community.🐍💜 🇨🇦&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyCascades2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyCascades2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Pz9QYWbhFU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Pz9QYWbhFU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Denny Perez (@dennyperez18) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dennyperez18/status/1637540480971046913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 19, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last talk of the conference was about the tricky thing of Zen of Python. It is a very interesting talk, especially for beginners that took the Zen of Python as rules for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last talk of the day &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycascades&lt;/a&gt; is about the (not so) zen of Python 🐍 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chrisjrn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@chrisjrn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ymFEPOjIHR&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ymFEPOjIHR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1637236576517226497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s day 1, after that, I did a tech check for my talk the next day then I head back to the hotel and wait for my cousin to pick me up for a family dinner. I have not met my uncle and some of my cousins for years and it’s good to grab this opportunity to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day 2, there is a lightning talk session at the beginning. There were quite a few interesting talks, including a talk about computational literacy, equity, and digital accessibility by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tonyfast.github.io/tonyfast/&quot;&gt;Tonyfast&lt;/a&gt;. Mariatta also gives a talk about PyCon US and we should submit our memories for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mariatta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@mariatta&lt;/a&gt; is telling us to join &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycon&lt;/a&gt; this year! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Ni2zecsaxH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ni2zecsaxH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1637491816533721088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 19, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I find a quiet place to prepare my talk. I headed to the green room before my talk and when it was time, the organiser and session host bring me to the room where I will be presenting. When I plugged in my computer, the unexpected happened: my screen is not mirrored but extended. It took me by surprise as it was mirrored the day before when we checked. So I have to do a presentation with live coding with my head turning to face the projected screen. It was a challenge especially I cannot see where the mouse was most of the time. Luckily the audiences are supper supportive and the talk ends up being well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Looking forward to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s talk, &amp;quot;Untangle Python Spaghettis - Deep Dive Into Environments and Dependencies Management&amp;quot;? Sound off in the comments!&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyCascades?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyCascades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/CfG7OIy8t2&quot;&gt;https://t.co/CfG7OIy8t2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VK6Myh4L97&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/VK6Myh4L97&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thx for joining us at PyCascades 2023!!!! 🥳🎊🍃🌄 (@pycascades) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades/status/1634630266831659008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that it was lunch time, I headed to the pub next door for a traditional Canadian poutine with Ricky, another speaker from Japan. We realised we were on the same flight from Tokyo to Vancouver the day before the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I have to go to my hotel room for a nap… all the jet lag and travel have caught up to me and I need more sleep. It was a struggle to get back up but I managed to attend the closing of the conference. It was quite an emotional moment as the organisers had put in a lot of effort to make it happen and I appreciated that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Awww it’s the end of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pycascades&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/8dYg540Sjs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/8dYg540Sjs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1637605550463635456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 20, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dinner, I was invited by Mariatta to have dinner at her place. It was very nice, the food was nice and it is a very cosy dinner with her friends. We all have a very fun time chatting and having good laughs. I am sure I will meet most of them in Salt Lake City during PyCon US next month again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sprint&quot;&gt;Sprint&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Join our in-person PyCascades Sprints projects! 💻🚀🌄 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/V2IKXzM1pv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/V2IKXzM1pv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thx for joining us at PyCascades 2023!!!! 🥳🎊🍃🌄 (@pycascades) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pycascades/status/1637870190808698880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 20, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of the conference is the sprint. I love attending sprints however, I know that I do not have capacities to contribute this time as work has been piling up. So I opted to sit on the side to catch up with some work. I also got a great chance to chat with Kojo about his experience in China and Hong Kong before. I love this conversation and can’t wait to have more when we meet again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet the organisers:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DevRelCon Yokohama</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My first time speaking at DevRelCon would be in this amazing city! I have always wanted to visit Japan again and this year. DevRelCon in Japan would be in Yokohama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I’ve enjoyed unofficial speakers dinner &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevRelCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DevRelCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gDX34edfx0&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gDX34edfx0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Atsushi@MOONGIFT (@goofmint) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/goofmint/status/1633807686545608707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 9, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived the evening before the event, and catch some of the speakers after they have dinner and we went to a mega-store - Don Quijote for late-night shopping. I almost forgot how convenient major Asian cities are and there are still many people walking around when it’s 10 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference started at mid-day, so before the conference, I had a huge breakfast at the hotel with other speakers and then wander around town a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Breakfast with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevWithTheHair?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevWithTheHair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/virtualized6ix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@virtualized6ix&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/7tUk3IUhh2&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/7tUk3IUhh2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Avie Dojo🇵🇭🇯🇵 (@AvieDev) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AvieDev/status/1634851425414156289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 12, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have some light food and then head to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have quite an interesting lineup of speakers on the first day. First, we have a Keynote by Jun Fujita who talked about the uniqueness of the Japanese market. One thing that I agreed with the most is the localisation need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;First keynote by Jun Fujita about the Japanese market &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/69Ub1tVA6F&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/69Ub1tVA6F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at DevRelCon Yokohama (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634044488078479360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 10, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have Joel, who talked about his practice in approaching conferences. It’s a useful reference for our strategies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next we have a meta presentation about presenting by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joel__lord?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@joel__lord&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IidlAZusg5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IidlAZusg5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at DevRelCon Yokohama (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634066288879480832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 10, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have Kim Maida talk about a highly quantifiable metric to measure DevRel values - &lt;a href=&quot;https://maida.kim/how-to-measure-the-value-of-developer-relations/&quot;&gt;Keystone DevRel Metrics&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth sharing with the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KimMaida?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@KimMaida&lt;/a&gt; talking about how to measure DevRel values &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lQao3cAmVi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/lQao3cAmVi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at DevRelCon Yokohama (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634083170739175424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 10, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marino talked about how to learn in public. It inspires me to do more streaming again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After the break we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/virtualized6ix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@virtualized6ix&lt;/a&gt; talking about learning and sharing in public &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/R2wGU8h1Jy&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/R2wGU8h1Jy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at DevRelCon Yokohama (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634095875671871488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 10, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we have the speaker dinners, since it is a joint event with DevRel Japan, we have a mix of international speakers and local speakers. We all socialise together despite the language barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Folks &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;Cannot believe Day 1 is already over💕&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SfTa1Ne3Nn&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/SfTa1Ne3Nn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alenka🇯🇵 @llamakarl@hachyderm.io (@gingy_love) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gingy_love/status/1634175385108901888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 10, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have a fun night. After a short break at the hotel and doing some work, I was invited to a Karaoke party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; speaker dinner is 🎊👍🏻🥰 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DQRIfRUJiP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DQRIfRUJiP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634175808825864194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 10, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the conference, we have only one track in the morning so I didn’t miss any talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the keynote is about how Google is doing DevRel in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Start of day 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; we have keynote by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taquo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@taquo&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt; Japan about develop ecosystem in Japan &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/sX3lkjDkf5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/sX3lkjDkf5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634374632626335744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we have Caroline talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/carolinelewko/the-developer-journey-map-k86&quot;&gt;Developer Journey Map&lt;/a&gt;, she encouraged us to play Bingo during her talk and there was a book giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After lunch we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CarolineLewko?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@CarolineLewko&lt;/a&gt; with her Star War skirt talking about Developer Journey &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Wf7zjaKYbU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Wf7zjaKYbU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634405982116933632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch, we have the option of sandwiches, mini burgers or bento boxes. I don’t even have a second thought and go straight to the fancy-looking bento.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;ja&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;ランチタイムは美味しいお弁当をお楽しみください！&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevRelJP?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DevRelJP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/rWTE8wF76W&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rWTE8wF76W&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; DevRel Meetup / 定期イベントは11月2日、カンファレンスは3月10〜11日 (@devrelTokyo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelTokyo/status/1634390057389035521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; full filled my fantasy for bento 🍱 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uyGjDdwzAM&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uyGjDdwzAM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634408230586818560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we split into 3 tracks and in the Suntory tract, have more talks before mine. For example, Hannah talked about the pain to get her company to approve using Meetup.com for organising community events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/palindromeotter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@palindromeotter&lt;/a&gt; talking about DevRel tools &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/b8gSyY3KsM&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/b8gSyY3KsM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634412682286874624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Salih talked about how to create suitable content for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/salihgueler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@salihgueler&lt;/a&gt; talking about Creating Content For Everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/9hG7mzs9J9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/9hG7mzs9J9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634437497194430466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it’s my talk. It is very nervous as the topic that I talked about is very controversial - about the pitfall of a very popular event. The representative was sitting in the audience so I may get some interesting questions at the end. luckily the questions that I was given were very good and I was very careful to present the topic purely from the perspective that we want to make the open-source community better. The talk was recorded (to be published).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After the break &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; it will be my talk ❤️ exciting &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/1G2SZ3kb4o&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/1G2SZ3kb4o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634448006316691456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my talk, there are a few more talks before the closing. One of them is by two Japanese speakers from the Jagu’e’r community (a community supported by Google Cloud) who dressed up as Pokémons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last of today &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ryoo_aki?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ryoo_aki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tmassh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@tmassh&lt;/a&gt; (not Pokémon) from Jagu’e’r community presenting &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hrtBT1KKkF&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hrtBT1KKkF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634470657970012160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we have to move to another room for the closing, we also took a group photo (which was a challenge as the room is small and we have quite a big crowd). Everyone cooperated to get the picture taken as we cannot wait for the after-party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you everyone for the great conference, especially for the organisers &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DevRelConTokyo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/COeOe0w6TT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/COeOe0w6TT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1634483580360601601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

See you next year! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bNhwwSwhJ1&quot;&gt;https://t.co/bNhwwSwhJ1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fWk54nIBDr&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/fWk54nIBDr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; DevRelCon Yokohama 2023 (@DevRelConTokyo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DevRelConTokyo/status/1635038928817500161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 12, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is not expected is that, when the conference is finished, it is followed by a lot of after-parties. First, on the 3/F floor of the same building. We have lots of food and slides Karaoke - you are given 5 random pictures and a random topic to do an improvised presentation. After a few drinks, I volunteer to do it… in Japanese. I finish my very random talk with very limited Japanese… but the magic happened, other local attendee start talks to me, in some English and some Japanese. I feel that I have gained their respect by trying. They start asking me questions about why I come to Japan, everyone is very friendly and we had a good chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am super tired and with the influence of the alcohol I decided to be wise and head to my hotel for a short break. I have heard there will be real Karaoke after the party (again!) so I need that rest. After a short rest and a coffee, I head to the Karaoke place and the room is full of people - there are more than 20 of us. I was told later that Karaoke place double as a co-working place… it only happens in Japan (p.s. I later found another co-working place that offers a sauna as well… only in Japan). Any songs can be popping up on the screen - Japanese songs (including anime songs), English/ American pop classics. The atmosphere is very nice and everyone is very friendly and supportive. I have been to Karaoke in many countries but in Japan, they cheer for anyone who was singing whenever a song finishes. It was a wonderful experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevRel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DevRel&lt;/a&gt; Karaoke is starting!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevRelCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DevRelCon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/0jdBSrd2d7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/0jdBSrd2d7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Atsushi@MOONGIFT (@goofmint) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/goofmint/status/1634525655336636418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 11, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that after party, there is another one… although the number of people joining drastically drops. We went to a typical Japanese Izekaya where we have gotten standing tables. We drank a bit more and have Izekaya snacks. The one I like the most is Kakitori (grilled chicken). My new Japanese friends are more talkative after a few more drinks and Ryota mention that his presentation partner Toshi didn’t speak English before and now he is chatting with us in English. I think the same goes for my Japanese. I am so glad that we can learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-events-in-japan&quot;&gt;Other events in Japan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because PyCascade is in Vancouver next week, I think it makes more sense for me to stay in Japan for a few more days rather than going back and forth for one more 10-hour long flight. But I do not waste any time when I am in Japan. I want to meet up with my friends and explore the tech industry here a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infobip-meet-up-at-ideo&quot;&gt;Infobip meet up at IDEO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a meetup run by Infobip. Some of their DevRels are in town for DevRelCon so they grab this opportunity to have a meetup at their Tokyo office. Most attendees are expected and some of them are looking for a new role. There are around 30 people in the room. The penal session centred around startups in Japan and it was interesting knowing how different the Japanese industry is different from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;speaking-at-le-wagon&quot;&gt;Speaking at Le Wagon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was invited by my friend to speak at the career fair at Le Wagon, where they trained people who want to change their careers in the tech industry. The school itself originated in France. The atmosphere there is very western. Everyone speaks English and the office/ learning space looks just like any shared office in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk about open-source software, what is it and why contributing to open-source can benefit someone like students, who are changing careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got a chance to meet up with Iqbal, the organiser of PyCon APAC in Japan. It’s good to catch up with him to talk about the community. I feel like now I am part of the APAC team as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; addressing the new comers to our industry and introducing the wonders of open source. Among the questions asked were, &amp;quot;why would big companies do open source&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;do you get people who ignore the code of conduct&amp;quot; or thereabouts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/L9jQuL2byE&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/L9jQuL2byE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Iqbal Abdullah 🇯🇵 🇲🇾 🇪🇪 (@iqbalabd) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iqbalabd/status/1635582925881360385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 14, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;datadog-x-contentful-meetup-at-wework-tokyo&quot;&gt;Datadog x Contentful Meetup at WeWork Tokyo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After speaking at Le Wagon, I went to the meetup at WeWork Japan. It looks just like any other WeWork we have in London but the decoration are Japan-themed. This time the meetup is smaller, maybe around 15 people at the end. But we have a good chat and again most of the attendees are expected attendees of DevRelCon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We got a successful the first time meetup event &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Datadog?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Datadog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Contentful?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Contentful&lt;/a&gt; 🎉&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for attending the event! And see you again soon! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5gd8GWgevs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/5gd8GWgevs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Taiji (@taiponrock) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taiponrock/status/1635647233273262080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 14, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both speakers are speakers at DevRelCon and I guess that also explains the collaboration between Datadog and Contentful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next talk is by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/taiponrock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@taiponrock&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/datadog?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#datadog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wxJk34GpJB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wxJk34GpJB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at PyCascade (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1635583728067158016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 14, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meetup-with-a-future-colleague&quot;&gt;Meetup with a future colleague&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I head to the airport to PyCascade, I managed to get in touch and meet up with our future colleague in Japan. We went for a coffee and chat a lot. He is a very nice person and I cannot wait to work with him closely when he officially joins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a very busy trip. There is so much going on and all the speakers are ready to socialise so I spent a lot of them meeting and socialising with new and old friends, especially the organisers in Japan, who are so hospitable and bring us to many places including local Izakaya and Yakineku places. Can’t wait to see them again at other events.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyCon Namibia 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am finally back in this beautiful country and meeting all these awesome people at PyCon Namibia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long flight that lasts more than 10 hours from London to Frankfurt and then Windhoek, I finally set foot in this beautiful country again! I was super tired but I cannot wait to meet everyone at the conference, so once I am done with everything at the airport, I head to the conference directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hello Namibia 🇳🇦 we are on our way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gbTcFbRi8T&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gbTcFbRi8T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1627963334698930176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 21, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, I was so happy to meet friends that I have not seen for 3 years. They are just having a tea break and were chilling by the pool. After registering, there is Juan-Luis’s workshop - he was teaching some beginners level Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Juan-Luis is giving a workshop &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5tfvzikTfR&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/5tfvzikTfR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1627976829465141249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 21, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it’s lunch, we are eating by the pool, the environment is very nice. I was a bit tired so I have not got many opportunities to talk to other conference attendees except Juan-Luis who was sitting next to me. Will try better tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Having lunch by the pool &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; - very unique to this conference 🇳🇦 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OqLRkooOiD&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/OqLRkooOiD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628013616673726465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 21, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I only stayed for a bit as I was so tired after the overnight flight. I went back to the hotel a bit earlier and then have our team meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After resting for a bit, I went to have dinner and then a social drink with the speakers. We went back to the place where we performed at an open mic night back in 2019. However, this time there aren’t any open mics and we just chill and drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A very intentional drink last night with speakers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; from everywhere (+1 random friendly folk from Switzerland) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MddooB2PQG&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MddooB2PQG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628288879672406017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 22, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the day we have the Humble Data workshop. But before, there are talks that are related to starting a career in technology and the attendees are very keen to ask questions in the panel session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Meet the panel at career panel session &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DXqe2A4WXP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DXqe2A4WXP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628306252055846913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 22, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the breaks and lunchtime, we tried to help as many participants to get the workshop materials and Anaconda installer copied over to their computers and start installing Anaconda (if they have not got it installed yet). Then after lunch, we have the Humble Data workshop. My friend John is showing how to open Anaconda navigator and explored some of the tools that are offered in Anaconda distribution. In the meanwhile, I troubleshoot for some folks who have trouble installing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; At a moment busy installing anaconda software with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; ,it was really a great chance of learning how to use anaconda software and cope python with through anaconda 🤗 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NYaL7UnGM7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NYaL7UnGM7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 02_luxury01 (@enias_jonas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/enias_jonas/status/1628603840097386496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we started, after a brief introduction, participants work in groups and they are all using Jupyter notebook to learn Python. The portion of participants, including the students, who are absolute beginners in Python is quite high. And most of them got through the first chapter of the workshop and learnt all the Python basics. We also had a fun quiz at the end and everyone was having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0UpiEoFnYOw&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, the organisers invited the speakers for dinner to sample some local cuisine. On the menu, some food is unique in Namibia including Mopani (a type of worm) and Smily (goat head). I was loving it but for some speakers who are from Europe the best things for the night are spinach and fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; organisers (including our camera man) for the amazing speaker dinner! I love it 🥰 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NrZ8qx9fRf&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NrZ8qx9fRf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628508969328119810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 22, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3&quot;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at the conference, the talks in the morning has already started. So I just chilled with some organisers by the pool. After the coffee break in the morning, I attended a few talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Andreea is talking about what is Data Science &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/57v7NJ7Kmy&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/57v7NJ7Kmy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628682677338402822?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After listening to the opening of John’s talk, I was summoned to the recruitment session to talk about Anaconda. We are not hiring in Namibia right now so I just briefly mention our company culture and that we support open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Recruitment session &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/HtIOuKve5p&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/HtIOuKve5p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628698336512409612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the recruitment session, I sat down to prepare &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/PCohAKCn1XQ&quot;&gt;my talk&lt;/a&gt;, it is right after lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; first afternoon session &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zgEbTK7Usz&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zgEbTK7Usz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ronald Maravanyika (@ronn_zw) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ronn_zw/status/1628728819086499842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my talk, there will be a workshop about Diátaxis documentation framework by Daniele. I have been to the workshop more than once, I am a big fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evildmp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@evildmp&lt;/a&gt; is giving a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Di%C3%A1taxis?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Diátaxis&lt;/a&gt; workshop about documentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qHaBXNjoLF&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qHaBXNjoLF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628739699333373952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the tea break, I was lucky to meet the chef that made us yummy cakes during the tea time. Some girls even ask her for her secret recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have amazing cakes during the tea time &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; salute to the chef 👩‍🍳 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4xsWof2wzm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/4xsWof2wzm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628749473223434240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tea break, there are a few more talks, then it is the lighting talk and the closing. Thank you so much to the organisers for the amazing conference! I hope I will be back once again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“The end” it’s sad to say goodbye 👋 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConNA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConNA&lt;/a&gt; thank you so much for the organising team ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/778rPc0xno&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/778rPc0xno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1628779805628895232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 23, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>PyCon France 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been 4 years since I gave a keynote at PyCon France, they are welcome to be back with open arms!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1---sprint&quot;&gt;Day 1 - Sprint&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the first flight in the morning and arrived around 10 am, the orientation of the sprint has already started. All projects are giving presentations and many of them are trying to speak in both French and English. I appreciated that. After the presentation, we all break out into different rooms to work. But before that, I got some coffee - the organisers gave us light refreshments and coffee. Seems they know I need coffee to function!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; sprint orientation, half of it is in French… I am not good enough at French to understand so I got a “I speak English” flag. Will get better next year! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/6akFc0OyRw&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/6akFc0OyRw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1626151610941317121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 16, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I still got work to do, after chatting with some friends and maintainers, I have to sit down in a corner to catch up on some work. But I managed to grab lunch with some folks that are sprinting and we sit outside to enjoy lunch and the nice weather - I do not miss London regarding the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I did a bit more work and then went to check in at the hotel. I took a nap as I woke up at 3 am to catch my flight. After my Zoom meeting later that day, I head out to meet up with my colleague and friends for drinks and dinner. It was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Had a blast yesterday for a drink with the folks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ZDdrdIg78P&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZDdrdIg78P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1626490235122077696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 17, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2---more-sprinting&quot;&gt;Day 2 - More sprinting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to wake up early but when I arrived at the venue, it was already 10 am when I got there. But people are still chilling at the breakfast table, so I guess I was not late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; was so nice to give us light breakfast and bottomless coffee for the sprinters ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ytRAKPQYTS&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ytRAKPQYTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1626587497928224768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 17, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I went back to the sprint rooms to work. But then I met Victor again! But he is busy helping the sprint with translating the official Python documentation to French. So he went there. I tried to finish as much work as I can then I headed to the city centre for lunch. This is my second time in Bordeaux but I have never seen the city in daylight! So I grab this chance to have lunch there and have a walk in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;fr&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Les esprits bouillonnent à la PyConFR ! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zyRfaDTbq6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zyRfaDTbq6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyConFr (@pyconfr) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr/status/1626256119797583875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 16, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, my colleague Sophia and I were having dinner together. It’s nice to hang out with your team once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3---conference-day-1&quot;&gt;Day 3 - Conference day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a very sunny day! After arriving and bag check, the opening is starting. Although I do not understand a word, the room was full of energy and people are hyped about the start of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; is starting 🤩 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zS0j9mfZL3&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zS0j9mfZL3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1626858493775908864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the opening, I do not have too much time to hang around as I have to give my talk in another room. The unfortunate thing is that the presentation stream setup is not done properly yet and we have a 15 mins delay due to technical difficulties. (I should sing a song while they are setting it up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; presenting Python memory profiling at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; 🙌 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/AUzJX6orGO&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/AUzJX6orGO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sophia Yang (@sophiamyang) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sophiamyang/status/1626873560303124480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my talk, I met a few friends outside and we chat with some organisers in France. The weather was so nice we went out to grab a gallette - a savoury crepe. I associate this food with PyCon France as in 2019 that’s what I had for lunch every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Will I have another galette today? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/AB3nFcAByB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/AB3nFcAByB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1627233572573655040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 19, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it’s Sophia’s talk, it’s about PyScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After lunch &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sophiamyang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@sophiamyang&lt;/a&gt; is giving a talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyscript_dev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/g3czDVkQeP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/g3czDVkQeP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1626930164847312898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I went to Max’s talk - he is from the UK but he is trying very hard to speak French there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time the wrap-up session of the day, I am already tired. So I went back to the hotel to lie down for a bit before the social event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/europython?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@europython&lt;/a&gt; announcement at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CfP?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CfP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FinAid?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#FinAid&lt;/a&gt; open on 6th March - there are also speaker mentorship program available ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OvTufRZVqm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/OvTufRZVqm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1626982299114799106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 18, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit lost when I tried to find the place for the social event, and when I got there, it was already packed with people. I was told that the catering company workers are striking so that explained why the organisers were serving the food themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Social event &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; with nice wine and food - the organisers were serving the food themselves - thank you so much &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UxlFUfbR03&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/UxlFUfbR03&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1627216035613908995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 19, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social event was great! I had many nice conversations with organisers from the Czech Republic and other local conference attendees. Only a few people do not speak French but at the end of the day, it does not matter, we all had a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-4---conference-day-2&quot;&gt;Day 4 - Conference day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning it was the annual meeting of the L’Association Francophone Python so I do not need to attend (it will be in french anyway). So I aim to be at the venue at 10 am. I arrived a bit early and had a chat with Marine of Taipy and she was so nice to offer me some Canelés which is the local delicacy. I hope I will be able to grab some to bring home later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Back to London from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; Managed to get some Canelés home ❤️ the trip ended on a high note &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tgRL1JWFTP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tgRL1JWFTP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1627446847131320320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 19, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning I gave my talk and also attend Raphaël’s talk about version control - the talk is in French so I was there to give moral support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Maybe the only French talk I attend this year - talk by Raphaël &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/9jeMgkDmGi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/9jeMgkDmGi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1627248150263070721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 19, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I grab some lunch at the food truck with Autur, a board member of the EuroPython Society, we spent some time in the after talking about ideas for EuroPython. I also managed to interview some organisers of PyCon France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Closing session - Did you had a good time &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconfr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconfr&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/kgSdkenlp1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/kgSdkenlp1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1627318201078906880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 19, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of the conference is shorter and we had a closing session at around 3 pm. Everyone seems to enjoy the conference. Congratulation and thank you to the organising team of PyCon France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>State of Open Con 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to this conference a week ago and I enjoyed it so much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I was a bit tired just coming back from FOSDEM so it was a struggle to wake up early to commute with other Londoners to the conference. I am glad that I did do to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have an opening by Amanda Brock, the CEO of Open UK. I talked to her later at the conference and she is really sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Keynote by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChiOnwurah?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ChiOnwurah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheLabourParty_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TheLabourParty_&lt;/a&gt; MP of New Castle upon Tyne at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOOCon23?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#SOOCon23&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gMqjkUbZwo&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gMqjkUbZwo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1622905228566618112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 7, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the first keynote is the by Chi Onwurah - the Labour MP of New Castle upon Tyne. I am glad to see the tech community connected with decision-makers and I think we need the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOOCon23?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#SOOCon23&lt;/a&gt; we have Damani Corbin from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Boeing?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Boeing&lt;/a&gt; speaking about their use of OSS &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/fhxoVBGkrr&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/fhxoVBGkrr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1622909428809842688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 7, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we have Damani Corbin who’s in charge of Strategy &amp;amp; EcoSystem Growth at Boeing speaking about open-source within their company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Good time at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOOCon23?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#SOOCon23&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openuk_uk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@openuk_uk&lt;/a&gt; 😊 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MUiD3LSeft&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MUiD3LSeft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1622987044581433344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 7, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After these amazing talks, I decided to take a break and walk around and check out the booths. I had a good chat with some amazing people. Including Deb, the executive director of FreeBSD and Nick who was the director of development at Open Source Initiative. I also got loads of swags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Let’s try the unconference at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOOCon23?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#SOOCon23&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openuk_uk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@openuk_uk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/K5SIph2sDp&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/K5SIph2sDp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1622945901735038977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 7, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I attended an unconference session, which is very interesting and there was a lot of discussion about open hardware securities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have to leave early after one drink at the all-hands party. I planned to attend the PyData London meeting that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another morning commute across London for me, and I am not a fan of it. However, I feel much better after a coffee at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Community building round table at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOOCon23?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#SOOCon23&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2KmcBzUtvN&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/2KmcBzUtvN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1623263257564745728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 8, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I decide to go for a roundtable session about community building. The discussion is interesting and I have learnt a few things. After that, I also have a very nice conversation with the host of the session and a teacher names Adam. We exchanged contact as he said he would like to invite me to speak at the school, we will see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch, I hang out with Sammy, my friend and organiser of PyCon HK. We don’t have much time to hang out while he is in London, so we may as well have a chat during the conference. After lunch, I went for another unconference and met a bunch of cool people how we later went to karaoke with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Got to meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; in person who is rockin Python and data science community work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/stateofopencon23?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#stateofopencon23&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/yc4mwp3LzZ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/yc4mwp3LzZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Bart Farrell (@birthmarkbart) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/birthmarkbart/status/1623332825935101952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 8, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the conference early to head home for more meetings. However, I went back for the unofficial karaoke party, who doesn’t love karaoke? I think the conference ended on a high note here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;State of Karaoke has started! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOOCon23?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#SOOCon23&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/oco1u0e8jk&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/oco1u0e8jk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1623436486266986497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 8, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there it is! I am glad to join the conference and I now I will keep an eye on all the Open UK events as I like what they are doing and the community is very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FOSDEM 2023</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After 2 years, FOSDEM is finally back in ULB. So has this biggest Open-Source conference changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friday---fringe-events&quot;&gt;Friday - Fringe events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived early on Friday early morning but it seems FOSDEM has already started! There are a lot of open-source events - which are called fringe events - already happening the day before FOSDEM. It is easy to see why - there will be several thousand folks who are interested in open-source software being there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tried to go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chaosscon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@chaosscon&lt;/a&gt; EU but accidentally went to a session next door about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPDX?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#SPDX&lt;/a&gt; Python tool and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPOSSUM?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#OPOSSUM&lt;/a&gt; tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qXdZsg2g9r&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qXdZsg2g9r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1621429583064039425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 3, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, I planned to attend CHAOSS con, which is a conference that my colleague Dave recommended. So I went to Bedford hotel, where the conference is after arriving in Brussels. However, I went to the wrong room and accidentally attended a workshop and licensing and security. The organisers kindly welcome me in and I sit for a talk by James. It is an interesting presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/purpleidea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@purpleidea&lt;/a&gt; for the presentation about Yes I Scan &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zY9ntsXH6h&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zY9ntsXH6h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1621433070267105280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 3, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I got the message about which room the CHAOSS con is, so I went there. I met my friend Lorna and Inessa there. I am so glad to learnt something about CHAOSS project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Finally able to get to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chaosscon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@chaosscon&lt;/a&gt; eu and it’s exciting &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/7ZanyYBkNK&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/7ZanyYBkNK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1621437826305871874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 3, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it’s lunchtime, we head to one of my favourite restaurants for lunch. We exchange information about what is going to happen on Saturday and Sunday in FOSDEM so I can get myself prepare to do what I want to do. FOSDEM is so big that if you do not have a plan, you will be overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It was great meeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/InessaPawson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@InessaPawson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lornajane?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@lornajane&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/chaosscon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@chaosscon&lt;/a&gt; EU &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hAa7zLmham&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hAa7zLmham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1621493207006601218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 3, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I head to check in at the hotel and take a short break. After that, I headed to the Python sprint meet-up organised by local organiser Hugo, who is also the host of the Python Dev Room this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Spent the afternoon at Python sprint before &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOSDEM2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#FOSDEM2023&lt;/a&gt; thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HugoHerter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HugoHerter&lt;/a&gt; for organizing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/europythons?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@europythons&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NhcL8E7fFA&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NhcL8E7fFA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1621546371068182535?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 3, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived there, there are not many folks, I guess there are so many things going on people like me just hopped in and out of different events. However, I was lucky to meet one of the organisers from Tai Wan, Peter, and happen to know that he will be having dinner with my friend Sammy, organiser of PyCon Hong Kong! So I decided to tag along and have dinner with the Tai Wan Hong Kong group. It was fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It was a great evening with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/singing_li?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@singing_li&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sammyfung?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@sammyfung&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConTW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConTW&lt;/a&gt; folks &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hHO4zxRLkY&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hHO4zxRLkY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1621612081895145472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 3, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;saturday---day-1&quot;&gt;Saturday - Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is exciting to come back to FOSDEM after so many years. I decided to volunteer at the cloakroom in the morning as there will be many people arriving and there will be many suitcases, and in our case because of the rain, coats to be stored so folks attending can enjoy the conference. During my shift, I met many people I know - including friends that I made at PyCon Italy. I am glad that they came to FOSDEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my shift, I am finally free to explore. I went to say hi to my friends’ booth, they gave me a lot of swags, I am glad that I did bring a bag. I also came across a lot of promotions about other interesting events. I bought a lot of hackable gadgets from various booths as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOSDEM2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#FOSDEM2023&lt;/a&gt; day 1, I had so much fun! Can’t wait for tomorrow! See you there &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KocDcdLZwW&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/KocDcdLZwW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1621933886358831104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 4, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also bump into an old friend Gerben who I met years ago at a Mozilla event in Berlin. We took a picture at one of those vintage photo booths together and I still keep our pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When is the last time you got hugged by your database? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PostgreSQL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOSDEM2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#FOSDEM2023&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zL23yelxeW&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zL23yelxeW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1621830683898396672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 4, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a shorter day as there is so many exciting things going on and I got tired before the event finished. I didn’t go to any Dev Rooms as the ones that I am interested in will be on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday---day-2&quot;&gt;Sunday - Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When is the last time you got hugged by your database? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PostgreSQL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOSDEM2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#FOSDEM2023&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zL23yelxeW&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zL23yelxeW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1621830683898396672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 4, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For day 2, I planned to split it between Community Dev Room and Python Dev Room. I arrived early in the Community Dev Room to attend the first talk by Matt. It is very useful for us as it is about building external evangelists. Then there are talks followed by my friend Floord and Inessa. After that, I head out with Floord and make some new friends - including Faruk whose team developed a lot of cross-platform open-source software for scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;1st talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/CommunityDevRoom?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#CommunityDevRoom&lt;/a&gt; is Matt’s talk that is DevRel / community relevant! Good one 👍🏻 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOSDEM2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#FOSDEM2023&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hbERK0Az12&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hbERK0Az12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1622144667063144448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 5, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I scout for the location of the Python Dev Room, as I don’t want to be unable to find it when it’s time for my talk. Outside of the Python Dev Room, I met Anastasia, who is another speaker in the same room. But it’s not time for her talk yet, so, joined by her colleague, we head to the food truck to find food for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lucky to be in the @PythonDevRoom for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anastasiatymo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anastasiatymo&lt;/a&gt; ‘s talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOSDEM2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#FOSDEM2023&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IM8GEaE8Yh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IM8GEaE8Yh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1622233841418047488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 5, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we head back for her talk. Then I took a short break to prepare for mine. My talk is the last in the Dev Room and it’s challenging - I am already very exhausted by everything in FOSDEM. But I managed and some folks came to me after the talk to ask more questions and I got connected to a few of them on LinkedIn. I hope they will try our PyScript and provide valuable feedback for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met Victor at the Python Dev Room. He has been a friend for years and during the pandemic, we only chat occasionally online. I am so glad to meet him in person. Later in the day, we have dinner together with other friends including the core maintainer team of Mecrial. Some of them will be at PyCon FR in 2 weeks and I am sure we will have more time to chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last social drink at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOSDEM2023?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#FOSDEM2023&lt;/a&gt; with some of my favourite people ❤️ until we meet next time 😊 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IJtYMU5UQp&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IJtYMU5UQp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1622358465120174082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 5, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that concludes FOSDEM this year. It is officially a 2-day event but because of its scale of it, it feels like a week-long event. This is an event that I am so glad to be a part of because that is where everybody goes and it is where you can meet anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also catch up on my talk online:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First event of 2023 - PyData Bristol</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My first event speaking live in 2023 is at the PyData Bristol meetup, which is also my first PyData Bristol. I am so excited and here is what I see and do there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-there&quot;&gt;Getting there&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I got notified that my train to Bristol has been cancelled. Recently we have train strikes in the UK so I am not surprised that something will go wrong with my train. Luckily it was not a last-minute thing. I decided to get on the train before it and arrive at Bristol a bit earlier than planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After boarding the train, I realised that the reason why the train was cancelled is that the region near Bristol was flooded so the trains are disrupted. Now I just hope that the train going home will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up not arriving at Bristol much earlier than planned due to the train that I was on was also delayed. However, it didn’t matter as I was on time for the meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pydata-bristol&quot;&gt;PyData Bristol&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at the venue, the first person that I saw was my colleague Valerio. It is always good to see familiar faces in a new place. Then, another organiser of the meetup come and greet me, with their help, I tested the computer setup and we are good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my talk is in the second half after the pizza break I got a chance to chat with the organisers a bit before the meetup. I was also spotting who would I be interviewing during the break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the meetup started, it is so exciting. The organisers made a very good introduction and I like the “ChatGPT nonsense of the month” session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataBristol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataBristol&lt;/a&gt; I finally made it here 🎉 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zmUl3SBibn&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zmUl3SBibn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1613604442082770979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 12, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first talk is quite interesting, we all learnt a bit about how computer chips are made with plasma and unsupervised learning from the talk by Greg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;First talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataBristol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataBristol&lt;/a&gt; is by Greygwho is a Physicist from University of Exeter talking about unsupervised learning in plasma physics &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/w9wXMqlZ0o&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/w9wXMqlZ0o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1613608643408035874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 12, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nest we have a lightning talk about federated learning, I am very impressed by the speaker Akiko, I think it would be great if she gives a full talk next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next up &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataBristol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataBristol&lt;/a&gt; we have Akiko giving a lightning talk about federated learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/G26zcmAQ6a&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/G26zcmAQ6a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1613615346245636103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 12, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it is the pizza break. I also use this chance to set up my presentation, and record and interview some people I met at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3phw8o96ZY4&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I gave my talk. I was so excited to be giving a talk again. I think I am a bit addicted to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my talk, it’s a lighting talk about NBFire, a cloud service to host your notebook on the cloud and run it on schedule. I think the idea is quite cool. I think our cloud notebook should have a run-on-schedule function as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is the end of the meetup. Some people will head to the pub for the after party, sadly I have to catch a train home. I would have spent the night in Bristol and joined the pub but I also miss my bed at home. It’s always a difficult choice for me as I enjoy chatting with the folks at PyData Bristol. I wish I can go to the meetup again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also catch up on my talk online:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to apply for Travel Grant/ Financial Aid from conferences?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/21/how-to-finaid-es/&quot;&gt;Haga clic aquí para la versión en español&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to conferences is exciting and it is a good learning experience, however, it could be very expensive to travel. Some conferences offer travel grants or financial aid programs but if you are new to applying, you may find it difficult. Here are a few tips to plan your travel and an explanation to help you apply for travel grants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;budget-it-well&quot;&gt;Budget it well&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in applying for a travel grant or financial aid program is to budget your travel. This shows that you are serious about going, have planned and knows that you will need the extra fund to travel. Here are some websites that I used to help me with budgeting, however, you can use similar websites or tools if that suits you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flights&quot;&gt;Flights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you live in the UK like me, most of the time you will have to fly to the conference. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skyscanner.net/&quot;&gt;Skyscanner&lt;/a&gt; for comparing flights and looking for connecting routes (if no direct flights are available). Most of the time, I will fly directly to the destination to avoid accidents that happened in the connecting and transfers. Also, make sure which airport you are flying to, come cities have multiple airports that are close to them and for some smaller cities, you may have to use the airport in the closest large city and connect it via coaches or trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it may be cheaper to travel a day earlier or later but that also weighs in on the accommodation costs. Normally, I try to arrive a day before the conference and leave at the end of the last day. But again it depends on the time of the flights available and the cost of the extra accommodation dates. Be careful that some grant programs may not cover the extra accommodation dates, so make sure you ask if it is ok to fly in the day before the conference and/or leave the day after the conference finishes if you plan to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the budget low, I usually travel with budget airlines. But beware that they usually have a very limited carry-on luggage allowance and have to pay extra for more luggage space. After years of travelling, I can now travel very lightly so most of the time I have no problem with that. However, I understand it is a very personal choice of how much to bring on travelling so if you need extra luggage, make sure you have put it in the budget as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For flights, 99% of booking earlier will be cheaper, so when you budget your travel, add a bit more (like 10%) in your calculation as when you are given the grants and buying the tickets it may be more expensive than the cheapest option you are seeing when budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trains-and-coaches&quot;&gt;Trains and coaches&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tricky one cause I do not know a website that provides all information in every country. In Europe and UK, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetrainline.com/&quot;&gt;Trainline&lt;/a&gt; to look for coaches and trains between cities. If that does not work, sometimes a simple google search will give you advice about how to travel from one city to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is usually cheaper to travel by train or coach than flying (except Eurostar which I love but can be much more expansive than flying with budget airlines) Also there are fewer restrictions on the luggage. If you live in the western part of continental Europe you can go to many places via trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accommodations&quot;&gt;Accommodations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For accommodation I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/&quot;&gt;Booking.com&lt;/a&gt; to search and compare prices. Nowadays they have included a lot of different kinds of listings and are not just limited to hotels. Some bookings would have free cancellation up to a certain date (usually a week or 3 days before your arrival), so for those, you can even go ahead and book it before the grant is approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most budget-friendly option is a bed in the hostel. However, the quality can vary a lot depending on who you are sharing the room with and also there are security concerns. I think it is a personal choice whether or not you want to stay in a bed in a hostel. I think the grant committee would understand if you have to look for a room all for yourself instead. If that is the case, hostels may not be suitable for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For hotels, there are many options. Usually, I look for one that is close to the event venue with mid-range prices. If the conference is located inside a hotel then the organiser of the conference may have a discount from the hotel, usually, it will be advertised on the conference website. If not it may be worth asking the organisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there are listing on Booking.com that is having whole apartments like Airbnb (you can also look for these on Airbnb). Depending on where you are going, this can be cheaper than booking hotel rooms. Beware of the check-in time of this kind of accommodation as they are usually run by individual hosts so no 24-hour reception is available. If you are having late flights then it may be a problem if your flight arrived in the middle of the night. So far I have not encountered a host that is not nice but I have heard stories that people have problems with this kind of accommodation so be careful when you are booking them. Try to check if the host is trustworthy and people’s reviews on those listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to save money by sharing a hotel room or apartment with a conference buddy (or buddies) that you know. Make sure to check the guideline of the grant program to see if accommodation sharing is allowed and if so what documents you need to provide. For example, if your buddy is making the booking and paying for it before you pay them back, then you may want your host to put your name in the booking as well as your buddy’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last accommodation option is to ask a friend to host you. I am blessed that after travelling to many conferences I have made some good friends and I am sure if the situation allows they will happily host me when I go to a conference in their cities. Make sure you also host them when they are visiting your city as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;local-transportation&quot;&gt;Local transportation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting around a new city can be exciting. Usually, the city that is hosting the conference would be either very walkable to have good public transportation. Do your research beforehand to check how to get from the airport to the city and how to get around the city. Get information about how to use public transportation. If you take local transportation You can also include that in your budget for travelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very worried about the safety of taking taxis (especially from the airport) so I will do some research to check if there is a trustworthy app that I can use to call taxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;food-and-other-things&quot;&gt;Food and other things&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also budget some money for meals. Normally conference will provide lunch (there may also be those who do not so please make sure you check), and there will also be coffee breaks with refreshments as well so breakfast, for me, is optional. Be expected that people go for some drinks and dinner together after the conference and it is a very good social opportunity. You can do some research to see how much it costs to be eating out in the city that you are going to. In some conferences, there will be sponsors who are very nice to host after-parties where you can socialise, and have food and drink there at no cost. However, it is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For internet connection, most accommodation and conference venues would provide wifi so it’s up to you to see if you want to have a local data plan or roaming service from your provider. Most travel grants do not cover this though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, the financial aid program will provide the conference ticket on top of your grant so you do not have to include it in your budget, but double-checking is always good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, check if you need a visa to go to the place you are going and the application time. Most grant programs will cover visa costs as well. But if you need time to apply for a visa, make sure you communicate and tell the organise committee you need that so they can assist you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after all the budgeting, you now have a good idea of how much you need to travel for the conference. Make sure you list the breakdown (e.g. how much for flight, how much for accommodation, how much for meals and loco transportation etc) when you apply for the grant. If you can afford part of the budget, also make sure you have stated that as well. For example, after all the calculations, you need $1000 for the whole trip and you can afford $400 to support yourself so you will need $600. Then you can apply for a $600 travel grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduce-yourself-and-why-you-need-the-grant&quot;&gt;Introduce yourself and why you need the grant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so you have asked for the money that you need. Now you have to tell the committee why you need it. I know, it may sound like you have to brag or beg but it is not. As the committee does not know you, think of it as introducing yourself to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you can explain that you are enthusiastic about the community. If you have volunteered or organised events locally for the community before, make sure to let the community know. You can include some links about the work you have done for the community in the past. Being active in the community helps in your application as by attending the conference you are adding value to it. If you are speaking at the conference, it is even better. Make sure you say that you are speaking at the conference as they need their speaker to be there and therefore speakers would have priority in the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, if you are in an underrepresented group in the community, make sure you let the committee know in your application. For a healthy community, we need diversity so the committee will consider that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, if your situation justifies that you need financial assistance, e.g. you are a student, you are changing careers, or trying to go back to work after a long break etc. Don’t feel afraid to say that. Your information will be kept private within the committee and they respect people’s privacy. I am sure they want to make the best use of the grant and give them to people who need them the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, if you feel like you don’t have anything of the 3 points above to talk about, starts today! You can always help and volunteer in your local community and start from there. You can even start a podcast, or newsletter or make educational videos or blog posts at home! There is always something you can do for the community and that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communication-is-important&quot;&gt;Communication is important&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing I would like all of you to know is that don’t be afraid to communicate and ask questions. Organisers and committee members are always happy to help and communication is important. So if you have any questions that are not covered on the website or FQA session, drop the committee an email to ask. If you need special help (e.g. apply for a visa), tell the committee and they can see what they can do. If you are given a grant but your situation changes that you need more or you don’t need it anymore, let the committee knows to they can reallocate grants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you luck in your next application and have fun at your next conference!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>¿Cómo solicitar la Beca de viaje/Ayuda financiera de las conferencias?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2022/12/21/how-to-finaid/&quot;&gt;Click here for English version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ir a conferencias es emocionante y es una buena experiencia de aprendizaje, sin embargo, viajar podría ser muy costoso. Algunas conferencias ofrecen becas de viaje o programas de ayuda financiera, pero si este proceso es algo nuevo para ti, puede que te resulte difícil. Aquí hay algunos consejos para planificar tu viaje y una explicación para ayudarte a solicitar becas de viaje. El primer paso para solicitar una beca de viaje o un programa de ayuda financiera es presupuestar tu viaje. Esto demuestra que te tomas en serio el viaje, que lo has planeado y que sabes que necesitarás fondos adicionales para viajar. Aquí hay algunos sitios web que utilicé para ayudarme con el presupuesto, sin embargo, puede usar sitios web o herramientas similares si te conviene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vuelos&quot;&gt;Vuelos&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si vives en el Reino Unido como yo, la mayoría de las veces tendrás que volar a la conferencia. Uso &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skyscanner.net/&quot;&gt;Skyscanner&lt;/a&gt; para comparar vuelos y buscar rutas de conexión (si no hay vuelos directos disponibles). La mayoría de las veces, vuelo directamente al destino para evitar problemas que ocurren en las conexiones y transferencias. Además, asegúrate de a qué aeropuerto vuelas, ya que las ciudades tienen varios aeropuertos cerca de ellas y, para algunas ciudades más pequeñas, es posible que debas usar el aeropuerto en la ciudad grande más cercana y conectarlo a través de autobuses o trenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A veces puede ser más barato viajar un día antes o después, pero eso también influye en los costos de alojamiento. Normalmente trato de llegar un día antes de la conferencia y salir al final del último día. Pero, de nuevo, depende de la hora de los vuelos disponibles y del coste de las fechas de alojamiento extra. Ten cuidado de que algunos programas de becas no cubren las fechas adicionales de alojamiento, así que asegúrate de preguntar si está bien volar el día antes de la conferencia o irse el día después de que finalice la conferencia si planeas hacerlo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para mantener el presupuesto bajo, suelo viajar con aerolíneas económicas. Pero ten en cuenta que, por lo general, tienen una franquicia de equipaje de mano muy limitada y tienes que pagar más por más espacio para el equipaje. Después de años de viajar, ahora puedo viajar muy ligero, así que la mayoría de las veces no tengo ningún problema con eso. Sin embargo, entiendo que es una elección muy personal el cuánto llevar al viajar, así que si necesitas equipaje adicional, asegúrate de incluirlo también en el presupuesto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para los vuelos, el 99 % de reservar con anticipación será más barato, por lo que cuando presupuestes tu viaje, agrega un poco más (como un 10 %) en su cálculo, ya que cuando te dan las becas, comprar los boletos puede ser más caro que la opción más barata que estás viendo al presupuestar..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trenes-y-autocares&quot;&gt;Trenes y autocares&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esto es complicado porque no conozco un sitio web que proporcione toda la información en todos los países. En Europa y el Reino Unido, uso &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetrainline.com/&quot;&gt;Trainline&lt;/a&gt; para buscar autocares y trenes entre ciudades. Si eso no funciona, a veces una simple búsqueda en Google te dará consejos sobre cómo viajar de una ciudad a otra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por lo general, es más barato viajar en tren o autocar que volar (excepto Eurostar, que me encanta, pero puede ser mucho más costoso que volar con aerolíneas económicas). También hay menos restricciones en el equipaje. Si vives en la parte occidental de Europa continental, puedes ir a muchos lugares en tren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alojamiento&quot;&gt;Alojamiento&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para alojamiento utilizo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/&quot;&gt;Booking.com&lt;/a&gt; para buscar y comparar precios. Hoy en día han incluido muchos tipos diferentes de listados y no se limitan solo a hoteles. Algunas reservas tienen cancelación gratuita hasta una fecha determinada (generalmente una semana o 3 días antes de tu llegada), por lo que para esas, incluso puedes continuar y reservar antes de que se apruebe la beca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La opción más económica es una cama en una hostal. Sin embargo, la calidad puede variar mucho según con quién compartas la habitación y también existen problemas de seguridad. Creo que es una elección personal si quieres o no quedarte en una cama en una hostal. Creo que el comité de becas entendería si tienes que buscar una habitación solo para ti. Si ese es el caso, es posible que los hostales no sean adecuados para ti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para los hoteles, hay muchas opciones. Por lo general, busco uno que esté cerca del lugar del evento con precios de rango medio. Si la conferencia se lleva a cabo dentro de un hotel, entonces el organizador de la conferencia puede tener un descuento del hotel, por lo general, se anunciará en el sitio web de la conferencia. Si no, puede valer la pena preguntar a los organizadores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A veces hay listados en Booking.com que tienen apartamentos completos como Airbnb (también puedes buscarlos en Airbnb). Dependiendo de dónde vayas, esto puede ser más barato que reservar habitaciones de hotel. Ten cuidado con el horario de check-in de este tipo de alojamiento, ya que generalmente los administran anfitriones individuales, por lo que no hay recepción disponible las 24 horas. Si tienes vuelos tardíos, puede ser un problema si tu vuelo llega en medio de la noche. Hasta ahora no he encontrado un anfitrión que no sea agradable, pero he escuchado historias de personas que tienen problemas con este tipo de alojamiento, así que ten cuidado cuando los reserves. Intenta verificar si el host es confiable y las opiniones de las personas sobre esos listados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si deseas ahorrar dinero compartiendo una habitación de hotel o apartamento con un compañero de conferencia (o amistades) que conoces. Asegúrate de consultar las pautas del programa de becas para ver si se permite compartir alojamiento y, de ser así, qué documentos debe proporcionar. Por ejemplo, si tu amigo hace la reserva y la paga antes de que tu le devuelvas el dinero, es posible que desees que tu anfitrión incluya tu nombre en la reserva y el de tu amigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La última opción de alojamiento es pedirle a un amigo que te aloje. Tengo la suerte de que después de viajar a muchas conferencias he hecho buenos amigos y estoy seguro de que, si la situación lo permite, me recibirán felizmente cuando vaya a una conferencia en sus ciudades. Asegúrate de recibirlos también cuando visiten tu ciudad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transporte-local&quot;&gt;Transporte local&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moverse por una nueva ciudad puede ser emocionante. Por lo general, la ciudad que alberga la conferencia sería muy transitable para tener un buen transporte público. Investiga de antemano para ver cómo llegar del aeropuerto a la ciudad y cómo moverte por la ciudad. Obtén información sobre cómo usar el transporte público. Si tomas el transporte local, también puedes incluirlo en tu presupuesto para viajar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estoy muy preocupada por la seguridad de tomar taxis (especialmente desde el aeropuerto), así que investigaré un poco para verificar si hay una aplicación confiable que puedas usar para llamar a los taxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comida-y-otras-cosas&quot;&gt;Comida y otras cosas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;También puedes presupuestar algo de dinero para las comidas. Normalmente, la conferencia proporcionará el almuerzo (también puede haber quienes no lo hagan, así que asegúrate de verificar), y también habrá pausas para el café con refrigerios, por lo que el desayuno, para mí, es opcional. Se espera que la gente vaya a tomar algo y cenar juntos después de la conferencia y es una muy buena oportunidad social. Puedes investigar un poco para ver cuánto cuesta salir a comer en la ciudad a la que vas. En algunas conferencias, habrá patrocinadores que son muy amables en organizar after-parties donde puedes socializar y comer y beber allí sin costo alguno. Sin embargo, no siempre es así.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para la conexión a Internet, la mayoría de los alojamientos y lugares de conferencias proporcionarán wifi, por lo que depende de ti ver si deseas tener un plan de datos local o un servicio de roaming de tu proveedor. Sin embargo, la mayoría de las becas de viaje no cubren esto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por lo general, el programa de ayuda financiera proporcionará el boleto de la conferencia además de tu beca para que no tengas que incluirlo en tu presupuesto, pero siempre es bueno verificar dos veces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por último, pero no menos importante, verifique si necesita una visa para ir al lugar al que se dirige y el tiempo de solicitud. La mayoría de los programas de becas también cubrirán los costos de la visa. Pero si necesitas tiempo para solicitar una visa, asegúrate de comunicarlo y decirle al comité organizador que lo necesita para que puedan ayudarte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entonces, después de todo el presupuesto, ahora tienes una buena idea de cuánto necesita viajar para la conferencia. Asegúrate de incluir el desglose (por ejemplo, cuánto por el vuelo, cuánto por el alojamiento, cuánto por las comidas y el transporte loco, etc.) cuando solicites la beca. Si puedes pagar parte del presupuesto, también asegúrate de haberlo indicado. Por ejemplo, después de todos los cálculos, necesita $ 1000 para todo el viaje y puedes pagar $ 400 para mantenerte, por lo que necesitarás $ 600. Entonces puedes solicitar una beca de viaje de $600.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preséntate-y-explica-por-qué-necesitas-la-beca&quot;&gt;Preséntate y explica por qué necesitas la beca&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, has pedido el dinero que necesitas. Ahora tiene que decirle al comité por qué lo necesita. Lo sé, puede parecer que tienes que presumir o rogar, pero no lo es. Como el comité no te conoce, considéralo como presentarte ante ellos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primero, puedes explicar que tienes entusiasmo con la comunidad. Si te has ofrecido en el voluntariado u organizado eventos localmente para la comunidad antes, asegúrate de comunicarlo. Puedes incluir algunos enlaces sobre el trabajo que has realizado para la comunidad en el pasado. Ser activo en la comunidad ayuda en tu solicitud ya que al asistir a la conferencia le está agregando valor. Si está hablando en la conferencia, es aún mejor. Asegúrate de decir que vas a hablar en la conferencia, ya que necesitan que su orador esté allí y, por lo tanto, los oradores tendrán prioridad en la solicitud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En segundo lugar, si se encuentra en un grupo subrepresentado en la comunidad, asegúrate de informar al comité en tu solicitud. Para una comunidad saludable, necesitamos diversidad, por lo que el comité también lo considerará.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;En tercer lugar, si tu situación justifica que necesite asistencia financiera, por ejemplo, es estudiante, está cambiando de carrera o está tratando de volver a trabajar después de un largo descanso, etc. No tengas miedo de decirlo. Tu información se mantendrá privada dentro del comité y ellos respetan la privacidad de las personas. Estoy segura de que quieren hacer el mejor uso de la beca y dársela a las personas que más la necesitan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y por último, si sientes que no tienes nada de los 3 puntos anteriores para hablar, ¡comienza hoy! Siempre puedes ayudar y ser voluntario en tu comunidad local y comenzar desde allí. ¡Incluso puedes iniciar un podcast, un boletín informativo o hacer videos educativos o publicaciones de blog en casa! Siempre hay algo que puedes hacer por la comunidad y eso cuenta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;la-comunicación-es-importante&quot;&gt;La comunicación es importante&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Una última cosa que me gustaría que todos ustedes supieran es que no tengan miedo de comunicarse y hacer preguntas. Los organizadores y los miembros del comité siempre están dispuestos a ayudar y la comunicación es importante. Entonces, si tienes alguna pregunta que no esté cubierta en el sitio web o en la sesión de Preguntas Frequentes, envía un correo electrónico al comité para preguntar. Si necesitas ayuda especial (por ejemplo, solicitar una visa), dile al comité y ellos verán qué pueden hacer. Si recibes una beca pero tu situación cambia y necesitas más o ya no la necesitas, infórmale al comité para que puedan reasignar las becas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¡Te deseo suerte en tu próxima postulación y diviértete en tu próxima conferencia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>PyData Tel Aviv 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;2022 has been a good year of events! After we have the first PyCon PT back in September, now we have the first PyData Tel Aviv. I am so happy about the friendliness of the people here and their hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arrival-and-speaker-dinner&quot;&gt;Arrival and Speaker Dinner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was excited to go to Tel Aviv as London was having a bit of a snowstorm, however, due to the same snowstorm, my flight is delayed for 3 hours. All passengers were waiting to take off on the plane but we have to sit and wait. The wait goes from 30 mins to 1 hour, then 2 hours and finally it took us almost 3 hours till we finally got a slot to safely took off. After all this stress, I was glad that the flight was not cancelled and I was heading to Tel Aviv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another 5 hours, by this time I am already spending the whole day on the plane which is not equipped for long-haul flights. I was super nervous as the organisers of the conference already arranged my pick up from the airport, and the airport was super busy. After getting lost and not about to find the staff member who was supposed to pick me up. I was nervous. But luckily, they finally come to get me and we are heading to the city. Since I was late, my plan to check in to the hotel and refresh before the speaker dinner is now out of the window, I am heading straight to the speaker dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Shout out for the organisers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; they help me to get through the busy airport fast after the stressful delayed flight! Thank you so much 😊 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/sJe9eu24k9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/sJe9eu24k9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602355106774753281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I was tired out from the journey, the warm welcome of the organisers and other speakers makes me feel energised again and I was glad that I can talk to so many amazing people. People will come and talk to me and introduce themselves. Sitting next to me was another speaker Aleksander who lived in Tel Aviv but is from Poland. He was super friendly and we talked a lot about the business and living there. Sitting opposite me were a few organisers and volunteers and when I said that I work for Anaconda, they are super happy and they were very interested in PyScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a great evening and after that, I finally got checked in to the hotel and rested after a long day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pydata-tel-aviv&quot;&gt;PyData Tel Aviv&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work up early the next morning, feeling refreshed after a good sleep at the hotel. I was so glad that the weather is so nice in Tel Aviv and the venue is in a convention centre park that got quite some greenery. When I step into the venue, I entered from the wrong entrance but the organisers guided me to the registration and I got my badge very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Good morning! We are having fun here &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; before it starts &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/kMLurERtAF&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/kMLurERtAF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602559572581011457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hallway, the sponsors already have their booth ready and were playing games with the attendees, giving out swags. There are snacks and coffee to give us energy before the conference begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So excited! 1st &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; for the 3rd largest PyData community ❤️ let’s go! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KHBVWSBeYX&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/KHBVWSBeYX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602560796009054210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the conference begins. After a quick opening, the first speaker is a keynote by Raymond Hettinger who is from Austin! As a CPython core developer, He teaches us a lot about how the math in Python works under the hood. It is very educational and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Welcome keynote speaker &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/raymondh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@raymondh&lt;/a&gt; 🎉 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zY63KZodea&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zY63KZodea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602562881098244096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the conference is split into two tracks. One is mainly in Hebrew and one is in English. Because of my limitation in language ability. I attend mostly English talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have a talk by Rachel Shalom about incorporating GAN in business analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; Talk about GAN in business by new mom and senior data scientist Rachel Shalom at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dell?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Dell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/jnAXXBkA82&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/jnAXXBkA82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602582713390825476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it’s a talk by Liron about sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;How to keep our sensitive data safe? Liron is going to teach us &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MeZcX65YDO&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MeZcX65YDO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602595097308184576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After, the next speaker Hilla, who is a researcher, talked about vaccine effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Glad to see how Hilla who did Physics 🙌🏻 at Trento taking about the effectiveness of vaccines &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JXAdZOzmLl&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JXAdZOzmLl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602605393624137728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it’s lunchtime. I got a lot of opportunities to talk to people in between talks as the conference allow 15 mins break between talks. I think it’s a really good buffer and let people have time to refresh and switch room for the next talk. I have talked to Tal, who is volunteering for the conference and he told me that he loves Anaconda. I have also talked to Rueven who has attended EuroPython before and as a trainer himself, he is very interested in the education aspect that Anaconda is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I would say this is the most sociable &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyData?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyData&lt;/a&gt; conference. 15 mins for changing tracks and talk to friendly people between talks! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/GJtTNE7Hfi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/GJtTNE7Hfi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602561973060870144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick lunch, I have to check the projector connected to my laptop as I will be speaking right after. However, after trying, I was told that the projector would not work with the newer model of Macbook, which is what I had. So one of the organisers was kind enough to let me use his computer for presenting. I was blessed with a full room of audience and they are all very responsive. I got quite a lot of questions after the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; hates writing tests. And you? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hmVN32fLin&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hmVN32fLin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyData Tel Aviv (@PyDataTLV) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV/status/1602629815517216771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Nir from DogsHub is speaking after me. He talked about how to integrate Jupyter notebook into the production process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/barazida?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@barazida&lt;/a&gt; talking about our favorite tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Jupyter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; notebook &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/mE6ocSH8Ou&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/mE6ocSH8Ou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602639345692860416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, there is a talk about data models for online harm. It is very interesting to see how a model distinguishes say, a video of someone cutting a tomato from a video involving violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next up &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; we have Matar and Noam talk about model for online harm &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/YHEKbTd2ar&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/YHEKbTd2ar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602650584317935619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, Dimitry Vanger talked about Extreme Value Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; is a talk about EVA - extreme value analysis, by Dimitry Venger &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zP4tpjCCVx&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zP4tpjCCVx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602661511415173120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the conference, there are lightning talks. In this conference, the lightning talks are pre-selected and approved and act like mini-talks that is selected from the proposal, which is very new for me. But I guess new speakers would appreciate and have less stress by having more time to prepare for their mini-talk rather than being spontaneous and be decided on the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; lighting talk time ⚡️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/adLJHDBAt1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/adLJHDBAt1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602676150743998464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And soon after, it’s the end of the conference. I enjoy the experience and I think all the organisers and volunteers for making such a great conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you for a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataTLV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataTLV&lt;/a&gt; conference! I really enjoyed it 🥰 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/X1NJ3AnXTt&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/X1NJ3AnXTt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataTelAviv (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1602684010551201793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go, there are drinks reception outside. So I get a chance and talk to more people. I met Jacob Barhak who took over the Python Austin meetup from Peter who founded it. Being in Israel now he said he could only organise a remote meetup for Python Austin at the moment and I think maybe we can help to find him a co-organiser in Austin. I also met a lady, Inbal, who organises open-source and C++ events in Israel. She is so friendly and I would love to introduce her event to our open-source teams in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is PyData TelAviv. I love the community here and so far it has been a successful trip.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DevRelCon 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When my colleague talks about DevRelCon, they said it is like a meta conference. Is it my second time attending DevRelCon. The last time it was before the pandemic in London. This time it is in Prague, a city I have never been to before. So it is very exciting for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1---devrelcon-day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1 - DevRelCon Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For day 1 of the conference. I chose to talk there from the hotel. However, it was raining and 2 degrees C so it is not a very nice experience. Also, I got lost and was unable to find the entrance to the event. But I catch up with Valerio on the way so we managed to find the entrance together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Good morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevRelCon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DevRelCon&lt;/a&gt;! Come on in, get comfortable, say hi! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/08ZzzSOcUP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/08ZzzSOcUP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; DevRelCon (@devrelcon) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon/status/1600025406094028800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After registering, the conference started and it started with a hypothetical conversation about why marketers need to work with the RevRel team. I found it interesting and had much to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Let’s get it started &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/mS8VjXGXML&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/mS8VjXGXML&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600044376901697537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it is followed by a talk about the DevOpDays around the world during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We love you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FloorDrees?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@FloorDrees&lt;/a&gt; ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JCqfbepHPJ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JCqfbepHPJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600049244093571072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is followed by a talk about how DevRel can survive economic downturns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next talk about economic downturn (what an exciting topic) by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RabbiGreenberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@RabbiGreenberg&lt;/a&gt; thank you so much &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ZvAGNXYbHu&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZvAGNXYbHu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600057444620677120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the coffee break where I met up with other DevRel friends who work for other companies. We come back to a small introduction about DevRelCon in Japan. I am very tempted to go to that one as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;There are tech mangas? You learn something new everyday &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KfR9pfErfD&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/KfR9pfErfD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600075882617511936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we attend a talk which is about how to scale up the communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we have a panel session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Panel session &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; after lunch &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5VvqYavtlT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/5VvqYavtlT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600115829852368898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a talk about managing CfP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; would be about CfP by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidgsIoT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@davidgsIoT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OtdYWIvmtv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/OtdYWIvmtv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600131812155457536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a talk that uses the physiological breakdown of how the community is all about oxytocin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last talk of today &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; is by Don from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KatsudonTech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@KatsudonTech&lt;/a&gt; the name of the company is making me hungry &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/YiMWsMyQBr&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/YiMWsMyQBr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600156842885189632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all these talks, of cause, we were given a lot of opportunities for socialising and talking to other DevRels. We end up talking to a DevRel with 12 years of experience and he gave us very useful pieces of advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2---devrelcon-day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2 - DevRelCon Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2, it starts with a talk about how to advocate for company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;First talk of day 2 of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; is by Brandon from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/datadoghq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@datadoghq&lt;/a&gt; who also a dog lover &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gL4nzD4w3B&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gL4nzD4w3B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600415465330774021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, it’s about advocacy within the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; is a talk by internal advocates from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Adyen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Adyen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VQ1XHK2lxd&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/VQ1XHK2lxd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600423599457808384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we attend a talk about how to start a champion program. Which can be quite useful information for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Next up at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt;, about how to build a champion program by Ully from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elastic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@elastic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nbeDT3oVYe&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/nbeDT3oVYe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600447307152908288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we have 3 lighting talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I love the pixel art by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcduiker?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@marcduiker&lt;/a&gt; ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Os9E2Qqgsp&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Os9E2Qqgsp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600483031688568835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have a Zoom call so we went out to a quiet place for it. After that, I talked to a few other DevRel in the “hall track”. I wish I have more time to talk to more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I attend a talk about diversity. This is something that we care about a lot in the community so it is very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;After a remote talk, we have Benjamin from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jetbrains?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jetbrains&lt;/a&gt; talking about diversity &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ubLX9amuYo&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ubLX9amuYo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600515039827460101?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost at the end. The last talk was about how we can up our value in DevRel, I found it very useful and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Then we have the birthday star &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattstratton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@mattstratton&lt;/a&gt; talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevRel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DevRel&lt;/a&gt; value &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UdmPLh87Zj&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/UdmPLh87Zj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600522652736802817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 7, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it all comes to the end. I enjoy this conference. I feel that I learnt a lot at this conference and the community is so nice. Everyone is very supportive and I feel that we understand each other and therefore we are super supportive of each other. I wish to go to more of this as this is very helpful in helping the team move forward and plan our journey to be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/devrelcon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@devrelcon&lt;/a&gt; for giving us a conference with such a good vibe, until next time ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DWS3eGVJeW&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DWS3eGVJeW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1600750764833394688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 8, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

        <title>PyBerlin and PyDay BCN</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about what I have in common in visiting Berlin and Barcelona (besides both cities’ name starts with B). I figured something. In Berlin, I gave a talk about Numba and run a PyScript workshop. In Barcelona, I give a Numba workshop and convinced some people to try PyScript. So can this be a Numba + PyScript trip?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1---pyberlin-day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1 - PyBerlin Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my early flight to Berlin, I arrived at the office. I checked in and stay on the 1st floor where I prepared for my talk in the evening. I do not mix with colleagues on the 3rd as I am still a bit unwell and afraid I may spread the cold to others. I also skip lunch gathering and head to check in to the hotel early to get a bit of rest before the meetup in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening I took the S-bahn to the venue. It is in a very nice and chill part of the city. After the opening and a talk by the sponsor. I gave my talk about Numba. The recording is available in the &lt;a href=&quot;/videos/by96j3fz6wy/&quot;&gt;video session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Super excited for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; speaking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/numba?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#numba&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyBerlinPython?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyBerlinPython&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/i4CrOj9kuB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/i4CrOj9kuB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; daniel ❤️😍😏😏😏 (@misterrios) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/misterrios/status/1595479577828245510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we have a small break and we attempt to connect with PyMunich it’s great to see some familiar faces on the screen. I like the community in Germany as they are all very connected instead of individual meetups in different cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Hello &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyMunich?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyMunich&lt;/a&gt; ! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laysauchoa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@laysauchoa&lt;/a&gt; I saw you &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bm8HDNj8Jx&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/bm8HDNj8Jx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1595475088316538881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are other talks. I got a chance to meet a few people that I know and met at PyCon DE. It’s nice being there but I didn’t stay for too long as I have to head back to the hotel and get the rest I needed. It will be a long week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2---pyberlin-day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2 - PyBerlin Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is event number 2. Originally I plan to go to the office but I am still not feeling 100% and also there’s a lot of work to do. I opted to stay in the hotel and get my video rendered. I also have a final check with the material that we are using at the PyScript workshop at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I head to the meetup place, which is located at a different place than event number 1. It is in the south of where I stay. I took the U-bahn to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyBerlinPython?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyBerlinPython&lt;/a&gt; again! Day 2… now it is similar to a conference &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/T8fL1YSgn7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/T8fL1YSgn7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1595834508611358725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 24, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the meetup, it is like a classroom setting where people got a tiny desks to work. We start with an introductory talk by Antonio my colleague who is in the PyScript team. Then we introduce the hands-on workshop. People can work either on their own or in groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;PyScript workshop is already in progress 🎙️🐍✨ Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antocuni?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@antocuni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/iPwJO90mQN&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iPwJO90mQN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyBerlin (@PyBerlinPython) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyBerlinPython/status/1595848395490746368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 24, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetup is very chill. My friends are also there so we had a good time chatting about the future event and conference plans, work to be done within the community etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3---barcelona-here-we-go&quot;&gt;Day 3 - Barcelona here we go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a travel day! So I pack up and check out on time to head to the airport. The experience at the new Berlin airport is now bad and I got to Barcelona on time. It is my first time in the city. The first thing I notice is that I do not recognise any words at the airport. Then I realise that the words on the first row are Catalan and the second is Spanish, then English. In Barcelona, their first language is Catalan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is, most people here speak English. So they speak at least 3 languages - Catalan, Spanish and English. It reminds me of back home in Hong Kong where people speak 3 different languages at various levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow Google’s advice and get an airport shuttle bus to the city. Then I took a metro to the hotel I am in. I am staying close to the PyDay venue instead of the city centre which I think it’s a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking in. I spend most of the time planning on Pyjamas Conf which is happening the next day. I am a bit nervous as I have to run both an online conference and give a workshop at the same time the next day. I am glad that I have friends to help and they are so reliable that I can trust them with many things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-4---pyday-bcn-and-pyjamas-conf&quot;&gt;Day 4 - PyDay BCN and Pyjamas Conf&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the big day! In the morning, I wake up early, have breakfast then prepare to start Pyjamas Conf. After the opening and a technical issue with the first speaker. I entrust most of the operation with my friend Martin and Cristián. Then I head to the PyDay venue which is only 15 mins walk from the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyjamasConf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyjamasConf&lt;/a&gt; 😀Great topics and great insights!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nh5G7DKTvy&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/nh5G7DKTvy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Samantha Haak (@samyhaak) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/samyhaak/status/1596486121542012928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 26, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the venue. After introducing myself to the organisers. I have a look around. It is a very interesting place. It is inside a tiny stadium that has been repurposed. But they still have a big terrace that we can use to take group pictures and socialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you all for attending the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyDayBCN?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyDayBCN&lt;/a&gt;!! 🥰 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/aJYf3L9TVZ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/aJYf3L9TVZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Python Barcelona (@PyBCN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyBCN/status/1596567778798014466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 26, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I sit down and pull out my laptop. I try to keep an eye on Pyjamas Conf’s live stream while socialising with people when I have a chance. I also want to practice my Spanish a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Had a great lunch! 🍴 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/BYCIaGN2vw&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/BYCIaGN2vw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Python Barcelona (@PyBCN) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyBCN/status/1596494809623326720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 26, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it’s time for my talk. I give my full attention to it. It’s again Numba. But this time it’s a workshop so people have time to work on it and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Cómo puede ser que &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; tan guay!&lt;br /&gt;Hoy se divide entre el &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyday?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyday&lt;/a&gt; y la &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyjamasConf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyjamasConf&lt;/a&gt; y además nos enseña a hacer Python más rápido 👏🏻👏🏻 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KeivgIocVF&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/KeivgIocVF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jimena (@Jimena_y_yo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jimena_y_yo/status/1596543834414256129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 26, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I attended the lighting talk session and the closing. It ended with a fun quiz. After the conference, the organisers invited me for a drink later in the evening. Since it is near the hotel I plan to attend after checking if Pyjamas Conf is streaming fine at the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Congratulations to the quiz winner. Thank you so much for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyDayBCN?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyDayBCN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyBCN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyBCN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UBhrcbWy35&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/UBhrcbWy35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1596551527434518530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 26, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking with Cristián that he can handle it while I am away, I have a few beers with the organisers. They are super nice and because I am there, they have to say everything twice - in Spanish and then in English. But I do like hanging out with them I try to speak a bit of Spanish but I am still not good enough to have a conversation with them. However, I managed to speak about PyScript to a few organisers and they know that we have passed the alpha stage and are excited to give it a try soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We love &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cmaureir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cmaureir&lt;/a&gt; because is hosting our sessions 🙈💖💖 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyjamas?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyjamas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; 🍻 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/1B6eehPvla&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/1B6eehPvla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jimena (@Jimena_y_yo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Jimena_y_yo/status/1596652402387865600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 26, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I head back to the hotel to “drive” Pyjamas Conf till Cristián woke up again in the morning. With help of volunteer hosts, it is not too hard to stay awake and monitor the situation. Except that we had one speaker missing everything was fine. We have a backup for that which is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-5---recover-from-pyjamas-conf&quot;&gt;Day 5 - Recover from Pyjamas Conf&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I carried on till the next day. I managed to get a tiny nap when we have a technical break between streams but things get much easier when Cristián arrived. I bit he was tired too but he insisted to help. Then when all is done, I gave the closing and now it’s time for a good rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Good morning! nothing better than waking up really early to continue following &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyjamasConf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyjamasConf&lt;/a&gt; ! if you are still around, or opening your eyes, drop by the stream! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/QY72HWLBBj&quot;&gt;https://t.co/QY72HWLBBj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyjamas?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyjamas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/community?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 「Cristián」 (@cmaureir) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cmaureir/status/1596739529578545152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 27, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up in the afternoon, I need to treat myself so I went to the city centre and have a bubble tea. It is not planned but I happened to see my favourite bubble tea chain in Barcelona and I cannot resists getting one there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;My treat after the 24-HR &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyjamasConf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyjamasConf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DTfT1MIT0l&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DTfT1MIT0l&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1596857978660876288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 27, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got a chance to check out the city and have dinner. I like it, especially the beautiful buildings by Antoni Gaudí, it looks so out of this world. I decided to get a ticket to visit one of his most famous buildings La Sagrada Familia before flying back home the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-6---going-home&quot;&gt;Day 6 - Going home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before flying home in the afternoon. I went to see La Sagrada Familia in the morning. Fun fact, it is still unfinished! The project has been started more than 100 years ago. I have seen many magnificent buildings before and most of them are centuries old. This is the first time I visit a magnificent building of our time. Imagine after a few generations, when people visited it and were blown away by it like I was blown away by Hagia Sophia. I hope I will get another chance to visit it again when it is finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the visit, I am prepared to go home and get ready for the next event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyData NYC and PyCon IE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am on the road again. This time is a bit far. I was wondering how I can be in New York and Dublin in a week. But somehow Dublin is on my way home from New York, all I need is an overnight flight so I can leave almost at the end of PyData NYC and arrive in time for PyCon Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-0---arriving-at-the-big-apple&quot;&gt;Day 0 - Arriving at the big apple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My flight took 6 hours and it arrived in New York late afternoon. After checking in to the hotel and refreshing myself, head to the speakers’ social at the fancy office of &lt;name of=&quot;&quot; company=&quot;&quot;&gt; The view was amazing. Then I join up with  Sophia and Erik for dinner before my jet lag called me to head back to bed.&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1---pydata-nyc-day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1 - PyData NYC Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the jet lag, I woke up super early. But then I spend some time working on my workshop and other stuff. I then get ready to commute like a New Yorker to time square. However, my phone decided to not give me internet once I step out of the hotel so a do navigate my way like a New Yorker. Luckily the NYC subway is easy to get used to and I remember which train to get from my adventure the day before. So I can get to Manhattan, even Time Square, with no problem. My only worry is that I may not be able to find the venue once I get off the station. But luckily, once I got out, there is a huge Microsoft sign at the entrance of a building and I know that would be the place for PyData New York. (Or at least someone there would know)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Breakfast is served &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pydatanyc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pydatanyc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/muQUXcwNug&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/muQUXcwNug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1590339087357333505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got there and picked up my badge and entrance pass (we need one each day for the escalator). What is waiting for me upstairs are coffee and breakfast. After the quick breakfast, I meet up with colleagues from Anaconda at our booth. We have a big table next to the entrance. However, many people confused us with the organisers and ask us conference logistic-related questions, which is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it is the opening. It has been 3 years and everyone was so happy to see each other in person again. We were reminded to wear a mask during the talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Open keynote of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pydatanyc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pydatanyc&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChelleGentemann?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ChelleGentemann&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NASA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@NASA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/8OmS2WotmR&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/8OmS2WotmR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1590348395822342144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first talk, which is also the first keynote is by Dr Chelle Gentemann from NASA. She talked about the TOPS program and the mission to make sure all the data and code in published papers are public and results are reproducible. I agree with everything she said and she also makes me understand the goal of the TOPS and the grant that we are trying to apply for. Later on, I got a chance to chat with her and further clear some of the questions that the team had about the grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sophiamyang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@sophiamyang&lt;/a&gt; is giving a talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HoloViz_org?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HoloViz_org&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pydatanyc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pydatanyc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2Kn6YilXSD&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/2Kn6YilXSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1590430746325704704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we are socialising around, have team meetings and then prepare for our talks after lunch. Sophia has her talk about Holoviz and I have my talk about Hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Amazing tutorial on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/numba_jit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@numba_jit&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; 🙌❤️😍 at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyData?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyData&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyDataNYC?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyDataNYC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/II1BRCheHM&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/II1BRCheHM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sophia Yang (@sophiamyang@fosstodon.org) (@sophiamyang) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sophiamyang/status/1591103303383121920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our talk, we like some fresh air so we went to the nearby Bryant Park. Since it is close to Christmas, there is a festive market there and Sophia likes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Happy memories with my colleagues in NYC &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/J3UtOfxPbj&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/J3UtOfxPbj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1592480492586426369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, the Anaconda team heads for a company get-together dinner. we walked there and have a small tour of the city. The food there is great and thank you Fara for the recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2---pydata-nyc-day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2 - PyData NYC Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still under the jet lag spell but I was able to sleep a bit longer. I head to the conference like the day before and was there at the keynote. It is by the 2018 Nobel Prize Winner in Economics Sciences Paul Romer. He had a very interesting insight into Jupyter and how to make it more useful for scientists. By making it more robust and more secure by including crypto signing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Keynote this morning by Paul Romer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pydatanyc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pydatanyc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3fomLSRsOo&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/3fomLSRsOo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1590709266847268870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat at our booth the whole morning while Sophia went to the fireside chat with Chelle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went out for lunch and have a walk on the Brooklyn bridge. We headed back just in time for the lighting talk and I was lucky to be about to talk about Anaconda’s support for me to bring Humble Data to Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening I went to socialise with other conference attendees, but then I decided to get more time to rest up by having an early night and dinner by myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3---pydata-nyv-tutorial-day&quot;&gt;Day 3 - PyData NYV Tutorial Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the day I give the new workshop about Numba. It is also the day I checked out of my hotel and leave the city. But first, in the morning, I had breakfast at the conference then I chat with friends at NumFocus booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After giving the workshop. I have to slowly wind down and prepared to leave. I got a chance to talk to Peter Vidos who is the maintainer of Vizzu. After that, I said Goodbye to Sophia and headed to the Newark Airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last week at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyDataNYC?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyDataNYC&lt;/a&gt; was a blast!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing presentations, top-notch projects, and a super welcoming, friendly atmosphere. The supportive, excited reactions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VizzuHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@VizzuHQ&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s open-source animated data storytelling tools were very encouraging. 🥰📈🎬🚀 1/5 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DGJTQsfIQK&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DGJTQsfIQK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Peter Vidos (@petervidos) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/petervidos/status/1592192217241862146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to make myself comfortable as the flight to Dublin will be the only rest I have between the two events… no sleep at all. Unfortunately, I was assigned the middle sit but I did the best I could to get a few hours of nap during the flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-4---pycon-ireland-day-1&quot;&gt;Day 4 - PyCon Ireland Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I landed slightly before 7 am local time. The flight was running early. I quickly get through the airport and call a taxi to the hotel where I will be staying and also the venue of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the hotel. They are so nice that gives me the only room they have for me to check in early! I was so pleased as I can at least refresh myself before attending the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;zxx&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/GGHaJ8Kmyp&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/GGHaJ8Kmyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1591452272705388547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get to the reception and realise they have an everybody contributes principle and speakers need a ticket too. Luckily the organiser opens the ticket sale for me and I can get a last-minute ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I attend the opening. after that, I was feeling so tired that I started to fall asleep. I am glad that my talk is not on the first day morning so I head back to the room to have a quick nap. When I wake up, it’s already lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Lunch time at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIe?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hd1k7rWM93&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hd1k7rWM93&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Python Ireland (@PythonIreland) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PythonIreland/status/1591424157178556417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch, I meet a lot of friends. One of them ask me questions as if he was waiting to meet someone from Anaconda to ask. It is about Nucleus and I will forward the contact and questions to the team for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I mostly talk with folks in the hallway. I got a lot of insight from Mark, my friend at Mongo DB, they have a booth there and from observing their work I got some ideas about how Anaconda can approach the future event as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And we&amp;#39;re live &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIE&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;Come talk to me about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MongoDB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; - maybe I&amp;#39;ll tell you a 🚜 joke. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vHBF1Z5mD1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/vHBF1Z5mD1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Judy2k (@judy2k) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/judy2k/status/1591367299532988416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end the first day of the conference by giving a Lightning talk about Humble Data at PyCon Ghana. Many people come to talk to me after about that and the feedback is positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-5---pycon-ireland-day-2&quot;&gt;Day 5 - PyCon Ireland Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day 2, I overslept a bit as the jet lag of coming back from New York is still in effect. I got my talk ready and then have lunch sitting with a girl from Argentina who just moved to Dublin. Dublin is a tech hub that attracts tech talents around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I gave my talk. People are so interested in it and I spend too much time in Q&amp;amp;A. I then chat with people who didn’t get the chance to ask questions in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;“Trying No GIL on Scientific Programming” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIe?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConIe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/7EVE0s9ulK&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/7EVE0s9ulK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sofi 👩🏻‍💻 (@EnriquetaSo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EnriquetaSo/status/1591793895381565441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my talk is finished. I was sitting in the lobby having a pint of Guinness and chatting with my friends at the conference. As the conference is situated in the hotel and some folks just grab beer or Guinness from the bar and socialise in the hotel lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Good bye &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PythonIreland?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PythonIreland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FoPQN1e4Mv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FoPQN1e4Mv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1591844447494766594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it’s time to say goodbye to Ireland. I head to the airport right after the closing is finished. I was hoping to get home not too late so I can relax before Monday. Unfortunately, there was some problem with our plane at the airport and we waited for more than an hour on the plane but the problem is not resolved. We have to get off and board another plane. In the end, there was more than 2 hours delay and by the time I got home, it was already very late. Ryanair was fine last week but it is not fine again this time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyCon SE and PyCon PL</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is another time that I went to multiple events at a time! I started with PyCon Sweden in Stockholm and end up being in Gliwice for PyCon Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-0---arriving-in-stockholm&quot;&gt;Day 0 - Arriving in Stockholm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took an early flight from London and so happened that Nicholas is on the same flight, we were even on the same row! But we didn’t chat much on the flight as it was super early and I just doze off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we arrived, Nicholas was waiting to be picked up by his friend Kushal and I head on to take the train to the city. The connection from the Alanda Airport to the City is great! It is so fast and in a blink of an eye, I am in Central station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Good morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Stockholm?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lnyLQMW0i6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/lnyLQMW0i6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kushal Das (@kushaldas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kushaldas/status/1588049038254940161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short walk, I arrived at Gamla Stan, the old town area. This is a tourist area and got many museums. I had lunch and still got a bit of time before check-in so I went to the Nobel Price museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I check in at the hotel. Have a few meetings and work a bit. Then I went to the conference venue, which is the same location as the hotel, to say hi to the organisers and help pack the swags for the attendees the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We are ready for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uD3n0cumCf&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uD3n0cumCf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kushal Das (@kushaldas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kushaldas/status/1588063394548142080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, Mahe and Valerio arrived and it was so great to meet other colleagues. We went to a Swedish restaurant for dinner and had a good chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1---pycon-sweden&quot;&gt;Day 1 - PyCon Sweden&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day the conference started, after picking up my badge, I had breakfast before the opening of the conference. I am impressed that they have to pull up a full-size conference in a short time and congratulate the team who made it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our chairwomen kicks of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/community?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#community&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ThePSF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ThePSF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladies?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/helioloureiro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@helioloureiro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kushaldas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@kushaldas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/xviHlGr5z5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/xviHlGr5z5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Anwesha Das (@anweshasrkr) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anweshasrkr/status/1588081067415797762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have our first keynote. Julien Simon from Hugging face is talking about how using the transformer on Hugging face can be very easy and accessible for coders who are not machine learning experts. He demonstrates object recognition for Swedish meatballs and tries to improve it by auto-train with more pictures of Swedish meatballs. The way he got the pictures of Swedish meatballs is not by scraping from the internet but by Stable Diffusion, an image generative model. Turns out Swedish meatballs are quite hard to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;First keynote is about hugging face &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MRrtOVv7rc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MRrtOVv7rc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataNYC (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1588087167850512385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the keynote, it’s my talk. Since I have delivered this talk more than a few times now I am confident about it and it was done quite smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Back to testing and hypothesis testing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyconse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hjfjDpURQo&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hjfjDpURQo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Vasyl Dizhak (@rootart) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rootart/status/1588113028242984966?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went back to my hotel room to prepare my new talk for PyCon Poland. I head back around lunchtime and forgot about the speaker photos that I am supposed to take with all the speakers at lunch. Turns out all of us forgot and no one from Anaconda remembers to be there for the speaker photos. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6994063411810562048&quot; height=&quot;740&quot; width=&quot;504&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Embedded post&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I chat with some people and then head back to the hotel room for more meetings. It is a busy week! After that, the Anaconda team regroup for dinner. We went for the recommendation from the reception and went to a traditional Swedish pub next door. It’s the only day that all the folks from Anaconda at PyCon Sweden sit together for dinner and we have some good chats and some &lt;strong&gt;secret&lt;/strong&gt; ideas for April Fool’s day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2---goodbye-stockholm-hello-gliwice&quot;&gt;Day 2 - Goodbye Stockholm, Hello Gliwice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day of PyCon Sweden, we start with a sponsored keynote. I also got the chance to finish up my new talk at PyCon Poland. I stay in the hall and chat with people after the keynote then head back to my hotel room to pack up and check out. Unfortunately, I have to leave early for Poland and miss all the great talks and workshops by the Anaconda team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our next speaker is ntoll talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyscript_dev&lt;/a&gt; and introduced by Py. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ThePSF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ThePSF&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hRJnuKlBZT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hRJnuKlBZT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kushal Das (@kushaldas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kushaldas/status/1588542493003780096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The travel to the airport and the airport experience has been great! Thanks to the very nice public transpiration in Stockholm. I am afraid things won’t be that easy for Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a bit more than an hour waiting at the gate, so I had lunch at the airport. I am starting to feel a bit under the weather so I sit down and rest before my flight. Luckily the flight is on time and I arrived at Krakow airport in time to catch the only bus that go directly from Krakow airport to Gliwice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waiting for a bit and learnt that Polish bus drivers are not people you want to mess with. I get on the right bus and started the almost 2 hours bus ride to Gliwice. When I arrived, I took a short walk to the hotel that the organisers provide and checked in. As I am still a bit unwell, I don’t feel like socialising for that night and need some rest. I went for a quick dinner nearby and head back to the hotel for more rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3---pycon-poland&quot;&gt;Day 3 - PyCon Poland&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At breakfast, I met some familiar faces, Laysa from Munich and Maho who we met at PyCon FR years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;LOOK who I found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconpl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconpl&lt;/a&gt; 2022!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Happy to meet with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; ☺️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NPh00tAc0O&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NPh00tAc0O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; laysauchoa (@laysauchoa) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laysauchoa/status/1589161219260551169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon Poland already started 2 days ago so I join on day 3 of the conference. The vibe of the conference is so different from that of Sweden. It’s in a university building and people are super chill. Sponsors got a lot of swag to give away which is a huge contract to the sponsor booths from PyCon Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you are at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconpl?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyconpl&lt;/a&gt; 2022, come say Hi 👋 to our sponsors!&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RevolutApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@RevolutApp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; scalosoft .com &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VQFVkjymrR&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/VQFVkjymrR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon PL (@pyconpl) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconpl/status/1588535120411389952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my badge and sit in the hall to work on my workshop for PyData next week. Then I chat with Filipe who is the main organiser of the conference. Later we had lunch when Laysa join me and also I met Tonis who is one of the organisers of PyCon Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Coffee break &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconpl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconpl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/57bKPNQZAi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/57bKPNQZAi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataNYC (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1588851178540265473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave my talk in the afternoon. It is a new talk and Artur (my friend from EuroPython) later told me that I got typos in the slides (Oops.. which is quite common for new talks) and people are interested in the topic of no GIL and making Python fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my talk, I sit and chat with two Armenians and you rarely meet someone in tech from Armenia. We talk about a lot of stuff including the harsh topic of global politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;pl&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dzień dobry! Good morning! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconpl?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyconpl&lt;/a&gt; 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/edIIZR7sN1&quot;&gt;https://t.co/edIIZR7sN1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon PL (@pyconpl) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconpl/status/1589222751696736256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the end of the day for the conference. I need some food (I only had soup at lunch). So I went with Laysa and Tonis for food and drinks. Later, we go to the social event venue and there are board games. Laysa brought her own game and she play it with Tonis and some other friends. I prefer to chat with Artur and his friends at the conference. We talk about what PyCon Poland was and could be in the future and the horrible Polish trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Social event for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconpl?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyconpl&lt;/a&gt; 2022 is happening now! Who is up for some boarding games?! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;🤪 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pN3m3cztZm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/pN3m3cztZm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon PL (@pyconpl) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconpl/status/1588983943319068672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-4---closing-of-pycon-poland&quot;&gt;Day 4 - Closing of PyCon Poland&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of PyCon Poland started with my talk. I am speaking twice in PyCon Poland this year. It’s about PyScript and I got a lot of people, including Maho interested in the topic and he was curious about the development of Python in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my talk, I am more or less done with the conference and since the weather is super nice. I took a walk with Artur at the park and back to the conference for lighting talks. Most people already left as it is Sunday and the conference is only half a day. Since I have a flight to catch, after the closing and saying goodbye to the organisers, I had a quick lunch and headed to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconpl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconpl&lt;/a&gt; and mark down 29th June to 2nd July for the next one &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/itDxEFglj9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/itDxEFglj9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyDataNYC (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1589250358953807875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;November 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back home, I need some rest before heading to PyData New York in 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyScript Dojo at PyLadies London</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After having this idea for a while. We finally have our 1st PyScript Dojo where people can learn Python and have fun at the same time. As PyScript is still very new, we are not ambitious to ask for creative projects but to get people interested and start writing PyScript for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we have Anna, organiser of PyLadies London, organising this evernt for us. She is very professional and makes sure everything goes smoothly and everyone is happy at the event. We are also very glad to have Infinity work hosting us at their beautiful office which transform into a theatre during the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event starts with people networking and having a bit. Then after a brief introduction by Anna, my colleague Nicholas gives out the background information and some technical knowledge about PyScript. Because he is such a good teacher, even though the details of PyScript can be very technical, he can explain in a way that even kids can understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our first &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyscript_dev&lt;/a&gt; dojo &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Oq1X5OoUob&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Oq1X5OoUob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1584979288142807041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 25, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I point the participants to try our PyScript by visiting the workshop materials I prepared and the official website of PyScript where they can check out the documentation and examples of what PyScript can do. I am so glad that people are working in small groups and most of them can finish the workshop materials. They also raise some very interesting questions and that helps me to understand from a learner’s perspective what is not clear enough and needs clearer instruction and better explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is a great event and there are plans to have another in Berlin next month. I hope it will be great as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyLadies, PyData and Friends</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a very rare opportunity to be doing a France-Germany tour of speaking at various meetups. The original plan was to speak at PyLadies in Paris, then to the PyData Südwest in Germany then to Berlin to give a half-day PyScript workshop. Since the workshop is cancelled. I will be joining the PyLadies Berlin event and visiting our Berlin office instead. What a trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1---pyladies-paris&quot;&gt;Day 1 - Pyladies Paris&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived in Paris in the morning, the first thing is to go to a shared office to work. Unfortunately, the one that I picked to go to is closed and the system has not been updated… so I have to head to the other one, by the time I finally got settled and work it is already 11 am. However, I managed to get some good work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch I checked in at the hotel, freshen up and work from there instead. I prepared my talk as PyScript has now graduated from the alpha version and the demo needs to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I messed up and the demo that I updated is for tomorrow. But since I arrived at the meetup venue early, I managed to update the demo I need very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you to our speakers &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; and Elias Dorneles for amazing talk tonight &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/talent_io?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#talent_io&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/kcCUun9d5z&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/kcCUun9d5z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; mojdeh rastgoo (@RastgooMojdeh) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RastgooMojdeh/status/1582437058735648770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief introduction and a few words from the host, I gave my talk. We also got online streaming set up so people can also watch it on YouTube. I got a few questions as folks seem interested and once again someone as if the Python package needed can be cached in the browser. I am sure the PyScript team is considering that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;re so happy to at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/talent_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@talent_io&lt;/a&gt; for another meetup, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; is talking about PyScript: Will PyScript replace Django? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyscript?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyscript&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NVNzLRWIAM&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NVNzLRWIAM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyLadies Paris (@PyLadiesParis) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyLadiesParis/status/1582425701214728192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, it’s the talk by another speaker Elias, who is an engineer from Brazil. Get a chance to chat with him after this talk he has also contributed to BeeWare in the past. He said it is good that Anaconda is now supporting BeeWare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Talk of Elias Dorneles begins now. Check it out at &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/sFzPM2ZuUG&quot;&gt;https://t.co/sFzPM2ZuUG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/talent_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@talent_io&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladies?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladies&lt;/a&gt; 💚 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bbof97QSoV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/bbof97QSoV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyLadies Paris (@PyLadiesParis) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyLadiesParis/status/1582429966624444416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetup ends before 10 pm, which is great as I need to get some rest after the overnight flight from Ghana and the early train ride to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cheuk.dev/videos/MqctbU9lMTU/&quot;&gt;See the PyLadies Paris meetup video recording&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2---pydata-südwest&quot;&gt;Day 2 - PyData Südwest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so glad that I don’t have to travel early in the morning again. I work up and stay at the hotel to work a bit before checking out. After that, I had lunch and headed to the Gare d’Est for my train to Germany. The first leg of the journey is to get to Karlsruhe HBF, I managed to work a bit on the train even though the internet connection is not stable. I have been told that my connection to Heidelberg has been cancelled and will have to find a detour to get there. Fortunately, my friend, Alexander, who is also the organiser of PyData Südwest arranged for his colleague, Florian who will make the same journey from Karlsruhe to Heidelberg, to pick me up and lead the way. It’s funny that in Germany face mask is mandatory on transport so once we crossed the border someone came and remind me to put the mask on. Luckily I always have one with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continue my journey with Florian and another lady. We took the train to Mannheim (where I plan to stay) and then connect to Heidelberg which is only 15 mins train ride away. I can now see why PyData Südwest covers all these cities as they are super connected and close to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataSW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataSW&lt;/a&gt; when will I go to all the PyData? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4Ew06wzD14&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/4Ew06wzD14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1582772135860539392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meetup was great! I gave a talk about PyScript and people are interested and want to try it out. I also got people coming to me and saying they love Anaconda. They said they have used it since they were in school and I am so glad to find fans of Anaconda and be able to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So happy to have ⁦&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt;⁩ speaking at ⁦&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataSW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataSW&lt;/a&gt;⁩ tonight about PyScript 🚀⁦&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt;⁩ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/QYH7keDi4w&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/QYH7keDi4w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyData Südwest (@PyDataSW) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataSW/status/1582775238693355520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3---pyladies-berlin&quot;&gt;Day 3 - PyLadies Berlin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I use the hotel room as an office before checking out. Then I join Alexander for lunch, where we will have spaghetti ice cream for lunch (Why not?). He keep mentioning that the spaghetti ice cream is invited in his city and said I need to try it when I drop by for years so today is the day. I would say, it is very creative and looks very interesting. It tastes just like a strawberry sundae so I would say it is more for Instagram than my taste buds. But Alexander and I were having a good time catching up and talking about the upcoming community events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;🍝🍦Some of the best parts coming to ⁦&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyDataSW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyDataSW&lt;/a&gt;⁩ is getting original spaghetti ice cream on the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lhTCnWHJeC&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/lhTCnWHJeC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alexander CS Hendorf 🏳️‍🌈🇪🇺💙💛 (@hendorf) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hendorf/status/1583036814428082177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I took the 4 hours+ train to Berlin. The train was quite busy and overall not a great experience. I managed to work a bit and sleep a bit but by the time I get to Berlin my legs were numb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to go to Berlin a few times per year so I am ok navigating the city. I arrived at the PyLadies open hack event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I made it! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyLadiesBer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyLadiesBer&lt;/a&gt; hack night ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/yXBcg33FSE&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/yXBcg33FSE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1583145856529682433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the event, I am so glad to meet friends. Including Jessica who’s the PyCon Namibia organiser. I have not met her since the pandemic and I am so glad that I don’t have to wait till PyCon Namibia to see her. She is currently working at a University in Berlin on a short project. She is such an amazing woman. We talk a bit about my plan to bring Humble Data to Namibia, and my experience in PyCon Ghana. I am looking forward to being in Windhoek again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I went to the office in Berlin where most Anaconda people go. Since it is Friday the office is quite chill. I got a chance to have lunch with my colleagues, we went to a burger place nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Glad to meet some of my amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt; colleagues in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Berlin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Berlin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3FQVNZZOiL&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/3FQVNZZOiL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1583424797954183169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 21, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>PyCon Ghana 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After my first time in PyCon Namibia back in 2019, I decided to attend a PyCon in Africa every year. My next one was planned to be PyCon Africa but then the pandemic hits. I participated online but I always wanted to go to Ghana to meet the amazing Python community. This year I got the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-0---arrival&quot;&gt;Day 0 - Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey to Ghana was not easy. Luckily I have a trusted companion, my colleague Nicholas. First, the flight was delayed, and the plane was super full, at least at the end of the plane where people were struggling to put their luggage away. So the flight was even later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived, the internet at the airport does not work. Though we know later that the organisers were trying to pick us up, we didn’t know that and trying to get an Uber was a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way, I guess it is because it was late at night, we were stopped by the police and they asked us to leave the car and they did a search on us. Luckily without too much trouble, they let us go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we get to the Airbnb, there was a problem with the key locker and it took us 30 mins to get the right code to get the right key. By the time when we get inside, we just want to go to bed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1---installation-party&quot;&gt;Day 1 - Installation party&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day went a bit better, the first thing in the morning is to get supplies for the flat. We need water as the tap water in Accra is not safe to drink. We walked down Oxford street (which is also the main street where we stayed). It’s a bit dangerous and a bit of fun cause there is no clear separation between the car lane and where people should walk. But everyone on the road greeted us saying “Welcome to Ghana”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we wait for the organisers to pick us up for the installation party which we help workshop participants to set their computers up for the workshop the next day. We have quite some people coming and even being a bit shy they have all gotten their stuff set up. And the mentors are being very helpful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyconGhana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyconGhana&lt;/a&gt; installation party, getting ready for the workshop tomorrow ❤️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qpwu4hhv5v&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qpwu4hhv5v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1580213413703131136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we had dinner with an organiser and another speaker from Nigeria. She is a community manager working for Outreachy, an organization that places under-represented people in internship programs in various companies. We have very nice conversations and the food is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then head back to the flat, and decided to have an early night as both of us are still tired from all the travel. And tomorrow we will have a long day for the workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2---pre-conference-workshop&quot;&gt;Day 2 - Pre-conference workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a very busy day, as I have to run the Humble Data Workshop in the morning and the Pew Pew workshop in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning we have a room of around 30 people joining the workshop. Some of them who have come to the installation party has got a head start and start working right away. Some of them are complete beginners in Python and it takes a bit of time for them to understand what’s going on with the Jupyter notebook. But luckily, we have very capable mentors to help out are they are so lovely. After about an hour, those who got Anaconda installed have already got the idea and are working fine at their own pace. For those who have not installed it, most of them have already started working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HumbleData?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@HumbleData&lt;/a&gt; workshop facilitated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; with attendees conference tickets sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt; saw the participation of diverse group of people: from absolute beginners to experts. Just Awesome! 👏&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PythonGhana?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PythonGhana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConGhana22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConGhana22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/humbledata?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#humbledata&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataScientists?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DataScientists&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NOuVHcuC17&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NOuVHcuC17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon Ghana (@PyconGhana) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyconGhana/status/1580601849484566529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the workshop, everyone was so happy and we all took pictures (including lots of selfies). They all now know what Anaconda is and has learnt some basic Python and can use the Jupyter notebook. Some of the ones who are ahead of others already asked me how they can keep learning and I point them to the local PyData group which is run by Dorothy who has also been a great help during the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch is the famous Jollof rice which the locals said I must try and the food which the Nigerian and Ghanaian are rivals of. I do enjoy the Ghanaian Jollof rice and would like to have the Nigerian version one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it is the Pew Pew workshop. I made a fundamental mistake - got the wrong batteries. Dorothy saves me again by running to the supermarket for me. She is amazing! In the meantime, some of the participants can get the Pewmulator running and so later can put the code in the Pew Pew when they are done. Everyone was having fun and they love the Pew Pew devices. I wish next time we can have ones that are designed for them but not the leftovers from the EuroPython which they are happy for me to bring to Ghana. Everyone is so happy to take the device home and I hope they can show their Pew Pew to their friend and family and inspire more people to start coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A super fun &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pewpew?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pewpew&lt;/a&gt; workshop &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyconGhana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyconGhana&lt;/a&gt; Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/europythons?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@europythons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/deshipu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@deshipu&lt;/a&gt; for the pew pew devices &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NsduYRfUjx&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NsduYRfUjx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1580614462478118912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening I had dinner with two ladies who are speakers from Nigeria. They are super friendly and teach me a lot of stuff about Africa. I learn something every time I visit and I can meet people from different countries. This just makes me better prepared for the next African trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3---conference-day-1&quot;&gt;Day 3 - Conference day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day of the conference started with the keynote, by Professor Nii Narku Quaynor who was the leader of the project of first introducing the internet to Ghana. He inspired young people in Ghana about the achievement of the technologies and the things to be careful about when introducing new technologies like bitcoin and blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Chairman of Ghana dot com,Nii Narku Quaynor &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/niinarkuquaynor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@niinarkuquaynor&lt;/a&gt; speaking on TrustKiosk System Organizing, Existing Payments architecture that works for 🇬🇭.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PythonGhana22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PythonGhana22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConGhana22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConGhana22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyconGhana?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyconGhana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KPQZNrvPU5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/KPQZNrvPU5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon Ghana (@PyconGhana) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyconGhana/status/1580869773415440384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I join the Microbit session by Nicholas for young coders (teenage students). I also got to try the Microbit and it is fun to play with. It is a good educational tool for getting kids into programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of chaos as lunch arrived late, I got to talk to some conference attendees, they are very curious and many people come and say that they have used Anaconda a lot but never met someone working there at conferences. I am so grateful that I got to meet them and encourage them to learn more about data science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closing keynote is by Abdoulaye Diack, a Research Program Manager at Google AI. Google has invested in AI and machine learning in Ghana. In the keynote, he talked about AI and in one demo, he has shown some generative models. The images generated are “street of Osu” and “programmer”, none of them looks like the streets in Osu and the programmers sitting in the conference hall. This shows that since the model and data used are from the west, it lacks diversity and does not represent the people and culture there. He encourages the local folks to contribute to open source to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The last keynote of the 1 day of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyconGhana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyconGhana&lt;/a&gt; was amazing. The demo at the end shows that the data to train those models are not representing the street and people here. We need more diversity in open source. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/o80MQbHRtP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/o80MQbHRtP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1581184154078654465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we are all tired and headed back to the Airbnb and have dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-4---conference-day-2&quot;&gt;Day 4 - Conference day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the conferences, we started with Nicholas’s keynote about coding education. He has this brilliant idea of using the music grade exam system to help people learning to code to be evaluated for their performance and to achieve grades. Many participants show interest in it. He also gave “homework” to the local folks to grow the local community and it will be the pioneer in code education in Africa when it is PyCon Ghana 2032.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Nicholas, my colleague at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt; is giving a keynote at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyconGhana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyconGhana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/rpgnJawp8E&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rpgnJawp8E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1581227842624688129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I gave my talk, which is about using Hypothesis to make testing easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Her smile &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyconGhana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyconGhana&lt;/a&gt; was contagious. Such an intuitive presentation by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She concluded - “…sometimes typing your code is a good idea.”&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyconGhana?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyconGhana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyconGhana22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyconGhana22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PythonGhana?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PythonGhana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/sgnDaTMuvV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/sgnDaTMuvV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; EL Sëmeion (@elssignal) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elssignal/status/1581246153865064448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I spend time chatting with people. I bought an electronic kit from the IoT community in Africa. Their creations at the booth are so fascinating and fun that without a second thought I immediately bought the kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I am into IoT now &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyconGhana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyconGhana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/aAHCsYP6Pi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/aAHCsYP6Pi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1581312157471604737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also get the chance to learn to play the game of Orawe, a traditional African game that involves marbles and a board with 10 indents, which represent houses in it. Each player takes a turn to move the marbles to gain more houses. The folks told me that it used to be a game of war to decide who is the king and also men used to be able to win the game to win their brides. For me, it’s a very fun game to play, it involves pattern recognition and some calculation just like playing chess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It’s not just Python but I learnt a new game &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyconGhana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyconGhana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/0fK4nJYPjF&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/0fK4nJYPjF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1581262141713428481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended the day and the conference with lightning talks and group photos. It is sad to say goodbye and I hope that I will attend PyCon Ghana again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we had dinner and social drinks with a few other speakers and the organising team. They were so busy during the conference and it is good that they got to relax and we finally got a chance to chat and know each other better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-5---post-conference&quot;&gt;Day 5 - Post Conference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our flight back home is in the evening, the organisers are so kind to bring us to see the Christopher Burg (the locals call it Osu Castle) and visit the Art Centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the tour at Osu Castle, we learn a bit about the Ghanain history and the brutal history of slave trading in the 18th centries. We then also visited the nearby Independent Square for pictures as it is the most iconic landmark of Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited the Art Centre to buy souvenirs. We are told that we need to bargain there so I put on my bargaining hat and start shopping. With the help of the local organising team, we ended up getting what we planned to get and were having fun bargaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so glad to have this opportunity to travel to Ghana and be part of the community there. I think it is a very good out reaching effort. I am surprised by the community, many of them are very talented and passionate about technology, data science and AI. I am also glad that many people know about Anaconda before and said it is a very good learning tool for them to transition to Data Science, some of them are teachers or developers. I wish we can do this regularly, reaching out to the Python and Data Science in Africa. I also hope the local community will organise more Humble Data workshops and I can bring Humble Data to more places and plant the seed there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyCon ES 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After having my talk (in English) accepted, I was told that PyCon Spain will be in Spanish… I start learning the language a few months back and see if I can survive… and I did!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-0---arrival&quot;&gt;Day 0 - Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before flying to Granada for the conference, I was on a Camino and was just passed the border and spent the night in a small village called Oía. So I already have an understanding that I cannot expect everyone to speak English. I am in the mood of trying to speak Spanish at any chance, and it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Disfruto churros aquí &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConES&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ahLFgcyJV1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ahLFgcyJV1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1575792923928567812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 30, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met up with a few people including the organiser of the conference. We had tapas and I was mind blown by the amount of food that we were given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Y ustedes ¿cómo llevan la &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConES&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConES22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConES22&lt;/a&gt; nos vemos mañana! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wjYKRA5piu&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wjYKRA5piu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 「Cristián」 (@cmaureir) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cmaureir/status/1575567296822550530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 29, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1---workshops&quot;&gt;Day 1 - Workshops&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day of the conference is workshop day and for people to pick up the badges. The sponsors already have the tables ready. I mainly spend time staying in the “hall track”. I tried to speak with some people. Some of them are happy to speak English with me but what I love the most is trying to speak to people who do not speak English and I have to try my Spanish hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After picking up my badge, I spend some time working and finished working on my talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConES&lt;/a&gt; comienza ahora! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/S6nzG6ovbX&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/S6nzG6ovbX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1575850345904963584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 30, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have the dinner for the minorities (PyLadies plus other communities that support minorities in the Python community). I would say the vibe is super nice, I got a chance to talk to different people (in English and Spanish). People asked about my work and I can tell them about Anaconda and PyScirpt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinner starts and ends quite late (especially for me who is from the part of the world where we have dinner around 6 pm), by the time I get to bed it’s already passed 1 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2---conference&quot;&gt;Day 2 - Conference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of sleep, I arrived at the conference on time for the opening and the keynote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief coffee break, I have giving my talk. The audiences are very interested in the topic and maybe we will see PyCon ES having sprints in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Muy 🔝 las primeras charlas del día en esta nuestra &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConES22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConES22&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Un saludo a las personas que están de chair de sesión y que van a tirar tizas ante cualquier “más que una pregunta tengo un comentario”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qpjOiNiQ3u&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/qpjOiNiQ3u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon España (@PyConES) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES/status/1576138579712933889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cheuk.dev/videos/c_hop_v1gj0/&quot;&gt;See my talk video recording&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went to a very interesting talk. From the technical point of view, it is about using MicroPython to control a mortar to vibrate. I would say the open-mind-ness and diversity of PyCon ES is one of the best in all the PyCon that I have ever been to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;quizás la charla más esperada &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConES&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FPlnk5cht3&quot;&gt;https://t.co/FPlnk5cht3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ahRNoRhe0x&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ahRNoRhe0x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1576165855565873152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, there is entertainment - a band is doing 90s anime and movie covers (I was told the performers are scholars in the university)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Sailor moon!!!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConES&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/N46LpPpPF9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/N46LpPpPF9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1576192308860817413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I took a break from the conference and then prepare my first ever lightning talk in Spanish… I would say it is my light talk of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; learnt Spanish to ask for submissions in Spanish for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyjamasConf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyjamasConf&lt;/a&gt; so please apply now!!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5bG5t225cA&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/5bG5t225cA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon España (@PyConES) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES/status/1576261214639824896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the conference, I attended the speaker and organiser dinner in a fancy dinner reception. I feel my artier for tech conferences are totally under-dress on that occasion. But the food is good and now everyone is so keen to teach me Spanish and that makes me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Foto grupal de la organización de la &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConES22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConES22&lt;/a&gt; de anoche. Qué decir más que está siendo una experiencia maravillosa y que, en palabras de &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fergunet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@fergunet&lt;/a&gt;, “esto no se acaba hasta que brindemos todes y digamos JUMANJI!!!”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ZLPFs3wAQ3&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZLPFs3wAQ3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon España (@PyConES) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES/status/1576527460140998657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3---conference&quot;&gt;Day 3 - Conference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of the conference is always challenging after all the socials every night. But I keep my discipline and be at the conference for the keynote in the morning. After that, I retrieved into the quiet room to do some organising work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went to a few talks after lunch, I try my very best to understand them and depending on the slides I can understand 10-30% of them even though it is in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;fr&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Una charla sobre Python y &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SnowflakeDB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@SnowflakeDB&lt;/a&gt; en &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConES&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tW41tzhwXP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tW41tzhwXP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1576526039626285058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it comes to the end. People starts leaving after the closing and after some emotional goodbyes, they all went home. (There was a small drama for people taking the train to Madrid but I a not affected as I am flying)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Cierre de la &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConES?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConES&lt;/a&gt; Mucho gracias 😊 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FZoRotOoE2&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FZoRotOoE2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1576597110618992640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am impressed by the conference and so far there is a huge Spanish-speaking community (they sold out 800 tickets, and it is only in Spain) that I have not been in touch with much yet. They are also contributors and active users in Python (there’s a translation project for translating the official Python documentation to Spanish) and I wish I can discover and learn more about this part of the Python community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad that I started learning Spanish and they welcome me who still cannot speak their language good enough to have a conversation. I will keep learning and hopefully, I will go to another Spanish-speaking conference (maybe in Latin America) one day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Django Con Europe 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so excited to be going to Porto for DjangoCon Europe and PyCon PT. It will be my first time in the city and the event. And it will be the first ever PyCon PT too. I have heard so many good things about Porto and Django Con so I think it will be great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arrival---day-0&quot;&gt;Arrival - Day 0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was greeted by the nice weather in Porto. After meeting other conference attendees on the metro, I arrived at the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In Porto, on a train towards my hotel. It&amp;#39;s been a LONG travel day. Coming up on 24 hours without sleep. But I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/m_holtermann?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@m_holtermann&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fapolloner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@fapolloner&lt;/a&gt; in the airport! We&amp;#39;ll, Markus found me.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kojo 🤔😴🤔 Idrissa (@KojoIdrissa) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KojoIdrissa/status/1572188774997848064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got lost because Google points me down a street under construction. Luckily (or unluckily) the worker opens the gate for me and I walk down it along the temporary wooden planks. Finally, get to the end of it and I broke through the gate on the other end to get to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After settling downtown at the hotel and a few meetings, I head out and have a look at the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Already felt in love with Porto because they have cute trams like we do in HK where I grew up. May love it more when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; kick start tomorrow &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wRNBnom4vI&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wRNBnom4vI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1572269779213246469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I head to the venue to meet up with other conference attendees for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The first evening in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Portugal?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Portugal&lt;/a&gt; was great 🎉&lt;br /&gt;We had dinner together with other participants of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DjangoConEurope?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; in the center of# Porto and then we had the nightcap before going to sleep 🍻 Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jvzammit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jvzammit&lt;/a&gt; for taking the photo 🙏&lt;br /&gt;CC &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KatiaNakamura?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@KatiaNakamura&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/glasnt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@glasnt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/m_holtermann?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@m_holtermann&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pj3qbMTO2n&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/pj3qbMTO2n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Paolo Melchiorre 🐍 (@pauloxnet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pauloxnet/status/1572359981856395265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;django-con-europe---day-1&quot;&gt;Django Con Europe - Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference opens with a keynote by Kojo. He talked about how to be inclusive in contributions. I cannot agree more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KojoIdrissa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@KojoIdrissa&lt;/a&gt; is talking about improving contributor experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LV08NiWXI7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LV08NiWXI7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1572505118108712964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 21, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I spend some time with other EuroPython organisers and check out the venue (as they have been interested in hosting EuroPython).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/europython?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@europython&lt;/a&gt; team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; ❤️ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/patrick91?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@patrick91&lt;/a&gt; is preparing his workshop unfortunately) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/rF6dNlBSn6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rF6dNlBSn6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1572544640993329153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 21, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I spent most of my time chatting with people and finishing my demonstration for my talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also gave a lightning talk promoting Pyjamas Conf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we have the speaker dinner, but before, we had an Ice Cream Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Welcome to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/IceCreamSprint?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#IceCreamSprint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/D7QpYDH6bl&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/D7QpYDH6bl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1572651111005257731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 21, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker dinner is a blast, we have so many people there and we are having the most iconic food in Proto - Francesinha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;django-con-europe---day-2&quot;&gt;Django Con Europe - Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day, I attend the keynote by Katie about what Django developers should be worried about. Then I gave my talk about PyScirpt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Cheuk Ting Ho &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt; is presenting the talk &amp;quot;Will PyScript replace Django? - What PyScript is and is not&amp;quot; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DjangoConEurope?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; 2022 in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Porto?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Porto&lt;/a&gt; 🇵🇹&lt;br /&gt;CC &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyscript_dev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NdHJWr7aCi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/NdHJWr7aCi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Paolo Melchiorre 🐍 (@pauloxnet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pauloxnet/status/1572877494675537921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 22, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I need a break from the conference and went to a popular Mc Donalds in the city centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Took a break from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; and went to the posh McDonald’s with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/judy2k?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@judy2k&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vk6y6x5xrU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/vk6y6x5xrU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1572894101808488450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 22, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After, I went back to the conference to socialise during lunchtime. Follow by meetings back at the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, I went on the boat trip, it is a very nice evening and the sunset is amazing. We had a good view of the city from the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last night&amp;#39;s boat cruise on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Duoro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Duoro&lt;/a&gt; river in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Porto?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Porto&lt;/a&gt; was a wonderful experience. ⛵&lt;br /&gt;Even more beautiful was doing it in the company of the other &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DjangoConEurope?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; participants 😀 Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; for organizing it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kolofordjango?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@kolofordjango&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring it 🙏&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/bridges?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#bridges&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/river?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#river&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/G62jNpa5U2&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/G62jNpa5U2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Paolo Melchiorre 🐍 (@pauloxnet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pauloxnet/status/1573228378014257152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, we had a social event. However, I went back early to conserve energy for the upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;django-con-europe---day-3&quot;&gt;Django Con Europe - Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the last day of the main conference. It opens with an interesting keynote about async in Django.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/carltongibson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@carltongibson&lt;/a&gt; is still very awake and give the morning keynote for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; after the social drink night! Let’s take a look at async Django &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nbdRMxVVdy&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/nbdRMxVVdy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1573237965869940742?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got a chance to talk to many people. The community is so nice and I feel like we can always have good chats with people from different parts of the world. Some people keep coming to talk to me about my PyScript talk and got a lot of useful feedback from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite some good talks in the afternoon including a talk by Felipe, the developer advocate at Snowflake. We got a chance to meet in person and I am sure there will be an opportunity to collaborate in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/felipehoffa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@felipehoffa&lt;/a&gt; is talking about using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SnowflakeDB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@SnowflakeDB&lt;/a&gt; for Django backend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EJe6D86MnU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/EJe6D86MnU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1573328129896087552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the closing, I took some time to explore the other side of the river and have some wine and food there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pycon-pt---the-first-one-ever&quot;&gt;PyCon PT - the first one ever&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After  DjangoCon, it is followed by the first even PyCon PT. Both PyCon PT and DjangoCon sprints are located at Porto University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The first ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConPT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConPT&lt;/a&gt; is starting now!!!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uJBjJ3TVwv&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uJBjJ3TVwv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1573594390647504896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 24, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a slight delay due to technical difficulties, the first ever PyCon PT is starting and followed by the first-ever Keynote by Daniele.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The first ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConPT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConPT&lt;/a&gt; keynote speaker &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evildmp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@evildmp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/S4GMJHb23r&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/S4GMJHb23r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1573596435286720512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 24, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the Django Girls workshop in the building, so many events happening all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kicked off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/djangogirls?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@djangogirls&lt;/a&gt; workshop in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DjangoConEurope?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DjangoConEurope&lt;/a&gt;! It is also the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/djangogirls?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#djangogirls&lt;/a&gt; workshop in Porto. We are all working hard with the tutorial! A big shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KatiaNakamura?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@KatiaNakamura&lt;/a&gt; and all the volunteers for making it happen! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MqHLAhgXeL&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MqHLAhgXeL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Çağıl Uluşahin (@cagilulusahin) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cagilulusahin/status/1573620717664468992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 24, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to pop in for Dash’s workshop for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iamontheinet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@iamontheinet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SnowflakeDB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@SnowflakeDB&lt;/a&gt; is giving a workshop &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConPT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConPT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/37dY8mkIaK&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/37dY8mkIaK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1573631722897506306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 24, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I am finishing some work and prepare for my workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So glad to be presenting &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConPT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConPT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/sQ5PTp01JP&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/sQ5PTp01JP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1573707488658169860?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 24, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, there are lightning talks. There was a talk about Using PyScript to deploy Django to the front end… I guess it’s the front end as a server?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyscript_dev&lt;/a&gt; Python in the browser someone make Django in the browser &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConPT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConPT&lt;/a&gt; lightning talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/s93gC6pvM1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/s93gC6pvM1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConES (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1573715723335213062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 24, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After closing, we all have a party outside. I had dinner with some friends and get ready for the trip ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;And now it&amp;#39;s time for a well deserved relaxing time!

        <title>PyCon UK 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite a series of unexpected events: train strake and the passing of the Queen. PyCon UK 2022 is still happening in Cardiff City Hall this year. So how was it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opening was scheduled at 11 am for a late start due to concern of the train strike (which didn’t happen) so people already gather in the hallway after the registration. There are coffee, tea and Wales cakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; opens with a hall track this year &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/taAIxm7dr1&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/taAIxm7dr1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1570707668075163650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it is the opening. This year Ann is chairing the organising committee and she is explaining all the house rules and the “toilet talk” this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Welcome &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5gwIWxyNbJ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/5gwIWxyNbJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1570714742922317827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After there are exciting talks, including the talk about Python Exceptional Groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IritKatriel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@IritKatriel&lt;/a&gt; is taking about Python exception &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hgzn9VutIC&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hgzn9VutIC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1570753158019960835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a talk about PyScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nekokawaigari?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@nekokawaigari&lt;/a&gt; is taking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyscript_dev&lt;/a&gt; and building a cool app with it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TgEVSyNNBy&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/TgEVSyNNBy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1570775234416091136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my talk about Hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Having used and given talks about Python&amp;#39;s Hypothesis library, I&amp;#39;m happy to learn about hypothesis.extra.ghostwriter which generates tests for you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconuk?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyconuk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tC4DlaESLg&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tC4DlaESLg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; tomviner (@tomviner) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomviner/status/1570795498059214848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to top it, Daniele talks about the relationship between documentation and software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evildmp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@evildmp&lt;/a&gt; is talking about the DogTail model of software and documentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2XBJdFfsgc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/2XBJdFfsgc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1570798769628934147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the conference and dinner, we socialise at our usual place. Where I had a great chat with Adam Johnson about my idea of deploying the trained model to the front end with PyScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 starts with more coffee and wales cake, then by the keynote. The keynote is about the flaws computational research can have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Day 2 keynote by Vincent Knight, proud father of 2, about why his computational research is not to be trusted &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/c5bqG9jmY7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/c5bqG9jmY7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1571054842461966336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I took a break to have a walk before lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I chat with some friends and have coffee (or better, an affogato)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/IceCreamSprint?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#IceCreamSprint&lt;/a&gt; is quite close thanks to the Brodies &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IKg05FOcUO&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IKg05FOcUO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1571126451038191618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the lighting talk, there are a few more interesting talks. Talk about speeding up your computation with Numpy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/t_redactyl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@t_redactyl&lt;/a&gt; talking how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/numpy_team?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@numpy_team&lt;/a&gt; can speed up your computation &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/mO0nys42Q0&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/mO0nys42Q0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1571158722478489605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And talk about the BBC and AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ben_nuttall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@ben_nuttall&lt;/a&gt; is back at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; 2022 (not 1916) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/b6YlRoB2Fm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/b6YlRoB2Fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1571160066518024193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 17, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lighting talk, I had to have a quick Ramen and then regroup at Tiny Rebels. Got a chance to talk to the organisers and it feels like homecoming at PyCon UK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3&quot;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 3 starts with a PyCon UK AGM, chaired by Owen. Then we are more talks in the morning, including Ian’s talk. Unfortunately, there were technical issues so it was changed to a lighting talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Ian Thomas is talking about UK census data &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uUtXtYcu79&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uUtXtYcu79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1571427926813581319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so glad that I was able to attend Daniele’s workshop about the Diátaxis framework (it’s a documentation framework and no you cannot install it). The first time I know about it was back in 2019 and since then it has evolved and I have learnt more this time in the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So glad to be able to join &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Canonical?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Canonical&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evildmp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@evildmp&lt;/a&gt;’s workshop on Diátaxis framework. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; Something I always want to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/yDgZanlTEI&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/yDgZanlTEI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1571465661057998849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day is only a half day and I am so glad that I can get home early and get some rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUK?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; delegates, enjoy your evening in beautiful Cardiff &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lbbRSy02bV&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/lbbRSy02bV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyCon UK (@PyConUK) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyConUK/status/1570841743913877510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 16, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Uptime Conference 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to Uptime Conference back in May this year. It is a conference organised by Aivan.io&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arrival-and-speakers-dinner&quot;&gt;Arrival and Speakers Dinner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organisers are very kind to organise all my travel and accommodation for me. There is minor trouble with EasyJet but I arrived in the airport, got picked up and transfer to the very nice hotel next to the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Setting up is complete - it’s time for Uptime &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uptimecon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@uptimecon&lt;/a&gt; - everything about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/opensource?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#opensource&lt;/a&gt; data technologies (and great coffee and Stroopwaffles!) - if you’re local to Amsterdam and would like to drop by, send a DM! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/buR3WQX9EF&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/buR3WQX9EF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; James Arlen (@myrcurial) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/myrcurial/status/1569936271044378624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short rest, we went for the speakers’ dinner. It’s great to be able to chat with some industry leaders and other developer advocates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uptime-conf-2022---day-1&quot;&gt;Uptime Conf 2022 - Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lornajane?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@lornajane&lt;/a&gt; is opening &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uptimecon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@uptimecon&lt;/a&gt; and start by the most important information - WiFi details oh no actually it is CoC &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/mIDUt5pLug&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/mIDUt5pLug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #uptime2022 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1569960484798873600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tech rehearsal, we chill in the speakers’ green room. Talk to more speakers. Then there’s the conference opening and keynote. It is a keynote by Jason who I chat to yesterday at the speaker dinner. The talk is about the SSPL licenses that create a storm in the OSS community for both MongoDB and Elastic. He explains what freedom in open source truly means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make use of the time at lunch to talk to various developers and conference attendees. They all have different backgrounds and some of them are not using Python mainly. I think it is a rare opportunity for me to talk to developers that Python is not their main language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My talk is in the afternoon. It is about an open-source project that I have been involved in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Revision control and databases?! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; up next “Better data governance with revision control workflows” 🧵&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/uptime2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#uptime2022&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/6An1VY67aU&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/6An1VY67aU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jenny Wong 🐝 (@miss_jwo) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miss_jwo/status/1570045087069138950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we have an after party on a boat. It is an extraordinary experience. I got the chance to talk to other developer advocates and it feels like a mini DevRelCon is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aiven_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@aiven_io&lt;/a&gt; for the nice after party &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uptimecon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@uptimecon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/L9y0XkhgjB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/L9y0XkhgjB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1570131851359961090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uptime-conf-2022---day-2&quot;&gt;Uptime Conf 2022 - Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day is a slow start for me, I have to save myself for the PyCon UK coming up the next day and catch up with work. But I got a chance to talk to folks at the conference. Including engineering managers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time flies and that’s the last keynote by the founder of the Apache Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Last Keynote of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uptimecon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@uptimecon&lt;/a&gt; 👀 see when open is more important than scaling up fast &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EyC0KKnPuH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/EyC0KKnPuH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1570419657043066887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it’s the closing. Originally I don’t expect to have so much fun and make so many great connections as it is not a Python conference which I am very used to. Everyone I met at the conference are nice and the organisers are very welcoming. Overall it is a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Closing note &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uptimecon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@uptimecon&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lornajane?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@lornajane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JC1aPQfL7B&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JC1aPQfL7B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho at #PyConUK (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1570428286777409538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 15, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-more-thing&quot;&gt;One more thing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have real time STT (done by professional real people) thought out the whole conference. The other conference that I have seen it are PyCon UK and PyCon Ireland and I think it is a great feature to be inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Wow, kudos to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uptimecon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@uptimecon&lt;/a&gt; for having live closed captions during the conference talks. Great job, first time I&amp;#39;m seeing this 👍. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JgU0Q5QKjk&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JgU0Q5QKjk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Gunnar Morling 🌍 (@gunnarmorling) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1569979343752892422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 14, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>I Have to Confess I Still Love Pandas 🐼</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few year ago, I was still a Data Scientist, Pandas was a tool that I have to use everyday. Soon time passes and I have used Pandas without googling and seems to forget the struggle I had when I was using Pandas for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope someone can tell me a little bit more when I start using Pandas so I can have a better understanding of it. So here are few things that I will tell my previous self and those of you who are starting to use Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-large-datasets&quot;&gt;What about Large Datasets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that Pandas (and Python) is using in memory, and handeling large amount of data is not what it does best. To minimise the problem, we can try a few tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you know the type of the csv, try using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dtype&lt;/code&gt; optionl:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path_movies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;usecols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'movieId'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'title'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'movieId'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'int32'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'title'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'str'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we don’t need &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;float64&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;int64&lt;/code&gt; (which are the defaults) all the time. This can also minimise the guessing and errors that may follow if the type of the column is input wrongly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it possible, processing in chunks:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;chunksize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;chunksize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;chunksize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;chunk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can make the io to databases and/or disk better. If you need speed, this can also be converted as concurrent operations, but we are not diving into details here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-apis-that-are-similar-or-do-the-exact-same-things&quot;&gt;What about APIs that are similar or do the exact same things?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing about APIs in Pandas is that, there are multiple ways of doing things, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting a column: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;df.user&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;df['user']&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sum, min, max etc: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sum(df)&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;df.sum()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Missing values: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;isnull&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;isna&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions is: Which one is better? which one should I use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my answer (and it is a personal opnion) - For the cases above, I will choose the later over the former. Why? There are reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using square brackets (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;) to reference a column because there are column names that have spaces in it and it will not work for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;using the numpy defined operation function orver the general Python build in fuction because it is optimise for that task&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;using the more commonly used method instead of the less popular ones (or old one) to advoid funciton being depricated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires some understanding of the ecosystem of Pandas to make the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-the-nested-indexes&quot;&gt;What about the nested indexes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nested indexes is a double edge sward in Pandas in my opnion. In some cases it is good that we can have multiple layers of index and columns but most of the time it just make data science operations more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for beginners, some time they maybe taken by supprise that after some operations (like groupby, aggrations and pivot_table etc) will end up with nested columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key thing to remember is, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reset_index()&lt;/code&gt; after those operations. Then nested structures will be flattened and columns will be renamed with the…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-about-quick-data-manipulation&quot;&gt;How about quick data manipulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandas offers ways to use SQL queries to manipulate the DataFrame, which can be very handy for those who are used to SQL queries and this can also be used to preview what you will get if you have a small sample of a huge data in database as a DataFrame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my presentation slides:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyConSK 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I have been to PyCon SK and I am impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pycon-sk-2022---day-1&quot;&gt;PyCon SK 2022 - Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived in the city late due to the delayed flights, just in time to catch Miro’s talk about encoding in Python (and how it messes up his name all the time)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I am lucky enough to sign up and gave a lightning talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Great lightning talk by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconsk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconsk&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconsk2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyconsk2022&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyscript?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyscript&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/WdfX4KVoxd&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/WdfX4KVoxd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Denny Biasiolli (@DennyBiasiolli) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DennyBiasiolli/status/1568262884601241601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we went out for food and drinks. Here is where all the ideas between various communities around the world started. I pitched the idea of PyScript Dojo to the organisers in Berlin and hopefully, we will have an event soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pycon-sk-2022---day-2&quot;&gt;PyCon SK 2022 - Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning I had a walk around town then I head to the venue. The venue is in the university but there are a few theatre rooms and a good hallway so perfect for a medium size conference. It is hall track for me in the morning and I slowly get back into the conference again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The hall track of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconsk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconsk&lt;/a&gt; is amazing! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Y9nLEMiX9y&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Y9nLEMiX9y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho 💙💛 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1568528586818076673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://2022.pycon.sk/en/speakers/Tom%20Dyson.html&quot;&gt;Tom Dyson’s talk&lt;/a&gt; about how Python can help us in a world full of depressing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tom Dyson talks about how to find happiness in Python… even though we have too many scary stuff in the world. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconsk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconsk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/afdjcO9ibF&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/afdjcO9ibF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho 💙💛 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1568564661657767936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I do some final preparation for my talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My talk is about PyScript and I am glad that there are so many good questions asked after the talk and people are interested to try it out themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; for great presentation on PyScript. &amp;quot;import d3&amp;quot; seems like dream came true for many people. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyconsk?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#pyconsk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FHermQSduO&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/FHermQSduO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jarmil M. Beruska (@jarmil_berushka) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jarmil_berushka/status/1568608315986296833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a Python quiz which is very exciting and fun. I did not get into the podium but still got the 9th which wins me a gadget that is useful for my future travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconsk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconsk&lt;/a&gt; for the fun quiz and now I have something that doesn’t hurt my ears during long flights &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/HEMVMjfecu&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/HEMVMjfecu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho 💙💛 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1568626131808436224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening there is the conference dinner. We talk about all sorts of things including the plans for future events in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Conference dinner &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconsk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconsk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KdTuMjXxoi&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/KdTuMjXxoi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho 💙💛 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1568669323798929414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pycon-sk-2022---day-3&quot;&gt;PyCon SK 2022 - Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is also the day I will go back home, I had a walk in the morning in the botanical garden next to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I manage to join the conference for half a day. I spent most of the time talking to people before I head to the airport. It is good to be able to talk to someone who may find Python in the browser useful in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://forestwiki.com/&quot;&gt;educational tool&lt;/a&gt;. I think this will be a good connection for the PyScript team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So many people here &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconsk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconsk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TbsMUCmfNw&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/TbsMUCmfNw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho 💙💛 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1568549482161127426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite impressed by PyCon SK, the local Python community here is bigger than I thought. Many sponsors are startups in this part of the world that treasure the Python community and see the opportunities in PyCon here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Swag swap with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gingy_love?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@gingy_love&lt;/a&gt; thank you for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/codekiwicom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@codekiwicom&lt;/a&gt; socks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconsk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconsk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vJrqt1s5Y7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/vJrqt1s5Y7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho 💙💛 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1568563981006082049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also an education focus in this PyCon. There is an educational track and there are workshops that some teenagers attend. Some of them are so talented that they have won a coding competition using micro:bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Kids are so smart here &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconsk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyconsk&lt;/a&gt; Coding in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Python&lt;/a&gt; and creat something with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/microbit_edu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@microbit_edu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nUHoOxFeO0&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/nUHoOxFeO0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho 💙💛 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1568567079908872195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 10, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got good opportunities to talk to a few people who have their work related to Education, and both of them show interest in PyScript. I think it will be useful for my work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PyLadies Munich 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What happened when we do Okotoberfest in PyLadies Munich 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pyladies-munich-oktoberfest&quot;&gt;PyLadies Munich Oktoberfest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it seems way too early to do Oktoberfest (a month earlier!) But when I was invited to PyLadies Munich, my good friend Laysa, the organiser of PyLadies Munich said that we gonna do Oktoberfest. So there we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;re back and so happy to be here! 🥨 💫🐍 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow us here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VqPS0KW3uz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/VqPS0KW3uz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/munich?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#munich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Oktoberfest?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Oktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nySz9ZDAs7&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/nySz9ZDAs7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyLadies Munich (@pyladiesmunich) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladiesmunich/status/1567202868544868353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends are all dressed up in traditional Bavaria dresses, I am so jealous. Next time I will also dress up to appreciate this beautiful city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with my talk, which is about Hypothesis. I hope it would be useful for anyone who hates writing tests. Look at my beautiful Anaconda T-shirt!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I hate writing tests, that&amp;#39;s why I use Hypothesis ✨ by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;👻✍️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Ias2GZkCoc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ias2GZkCoc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyLadies Munich (@pyladiesmunich) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladiesmunich/status/1567203273945321473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have an interesting talk about running Cloud Run after the break. There were lots of cute doggie pictures involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;es&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Run Cloud Run by Alejandra Bolaños 🌩️🏃🏃‍♀ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TgnhXUBMmm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/TgnhXUBMmm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyLadies Munich (@pyladiesmunich) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladiesmunich/status/1567211921383866378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we have the talk about redirecting old URI to new ones, I can feel the pain doing so, but it’a a fun talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;When 404 becomes 302 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lorinkoz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@lorinkoz&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tech_alasco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@tech_alasco&lt;/a&gt; 💙 Our last speaker for tonight!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MDS4S0lCjY&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MDS4S0lCjY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyLadies Munich (@pyladiesmunich) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladiesmunich/status/1567216965130850307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I got a chance to talk to everyone. New faces that I have never met before and old faces that I have met in PyCon DE. All of them are very nice. I love the community here it’s such a good place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;My happy face due to partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladiesmunich?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladiesmunich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laysauchoa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@laysauchoa&lt;/a&gt; to kick the on-site &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/community?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#community&lt;/a&gt; experience off and finally meet in person 🥨🥳🙌🚀🍻&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/sharingiscaring?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#sharingiscaring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/22thh0YbJb&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/22thh0YbJb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Uliana Andriieshyna (@uliana_munich) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/uliana_munich/status/1567245315698315270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>EuroSciPy 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a little blog post about what I see and what I do in EuroSciPy 2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1---arriving-basel-tutorial-day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1 - Arriving Basel, tutorial day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long trip from London, I finally arriving Basel. Arrived just in time for lunch on the first tutorial day. After chatting with the organizers, who are very nice and welcoming. I greet my friends who also just arrived. During lunch, I also chat with the Scikit Learn maintainers who lived in France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;well deserved break after gripping tutorials about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyTorch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyTorch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SciPy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#SciPy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/scikit?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#scikit&lt;/a&gt;-learn and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeoPandas?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#GeoPandas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EuroSciPy2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EuroSciPy2022&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EuroSciPy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EuroSciPy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Basel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Basel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/PivCAAwxPJ&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/PivCAAwxPJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; EuroSciPy (@EuroSciPy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy/status/1564605837506740225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 30, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, I join the tutorial by the SciKit Learn team: &lt;strong&gt;Evaluating your machine learning models&lt;/strong&gt; which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Cheukting?tab=stars#:~:text=ArturoAmorQ%20/%20euroscipy_2022_evaluation&quot;&gt;very informative&lt;/a&gt; and is showing an academic approach to measuring and comparing models with “better” metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next is a tutorial about ASR &lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Audio &amp;amp; Speech Recognition&lt;/strong&gt; it’s fun but the workshop requires some prior knowledge and seems not all audiences are so there are a lot of questions and the tutorial quickly runs out of time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Cheukting?tab=stars#:~:text=Vaibhavs10%20/%20how%2Dto%2Dasr&quot;&gt;The material&lt;/a&gt; is very detailed though. It may be worth going through them when have time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening, a big group of us had a drink and food &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/y5ZEfQuyFHwEd7WVA&quot;&gt;near the river&lt;/a&gt;, which is very relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Good software is good peopleware.

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2---tutorial-day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2 - Tutorial day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/leriomaggio/euroscipy22-pytorch&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; by my colleague Valerio about &lt;strong&gt;PyTouch&lt;/strong&gt;, it has been a while since I do any deep learning thing so it is interesting to know PyTouch is getting more popular now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our developer advocate 🥑 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leriomaggio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@leriomaggio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt; is giving a tutorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@EuroSciPy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Jr3uvYBdH9&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/Jr3uvYBdH9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho 💙💛 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1564505323452375046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 30, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I spend some time finalizing my demo and presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we had a walk and have ice cream. I usually bookmark ice cream places that I like and it’s coming in handy now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I took a break from the tutorials and caught up with some work and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colleague Jannis from the Conda team join us for the evening and we talk a lot, including about what community work we can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3---conference-day-1&quot;&gt;Day 3 - Conference day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Yay EuroSciPy opening session, so good to be back in person 🚀🤗 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IQrI9TmR6T&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/IQrI9TmR6T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; EuroSciPy (@EuroSciPy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy/status/1564872173059293184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 31, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two very interesting keynotes in the morning, especially the one by Emmanuelle Gouillart about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dash.gallery/Portal/&quot;&gt;scikit image in plotly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. You can auto annotate tumours by squiggling on the picture. I got inspired by this talk a lot and have a new idea of what I can try next (which I am not telling yet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Interactive image annotation with plotly and dash&lt;br /&gt; presented by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EGouillart?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@EGouillart&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/euroscipy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#euroscipy&lt;/a&gt;. I wonder how easy it would be to make the annotations created on &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SNfEiblWJI&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SNfEiblWJI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/IIIF?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#IIIF&lt;/a&gt; / Web Annotation compliant? :) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@EuroSciPy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VCGZXWUHEL&quot;&gt;https://t.co/VCGZXWUHEL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Julien A. Raemy (@julsraemy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/julsraemy/status/1564897924752019457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 31, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the &lt;strong&gt;conda-forge&lt;/strong&gt; talk by 3 speakers from different companies, Jannis is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Wonderful community collaboration example &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@EuroSciPy&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jaime_rgp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jaime_rgp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/quansightai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@quansightai&lt;/a&gt; ➕ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wuoulf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@wuoulf&lt;/a&gt; @QuantStackand &amp;amp; the one and only &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jezdez?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@jezdez&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anacondainc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@anacondainc&lt;/a&gt; talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/condaforge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@condaforge&lt;/a&gt; 👏🏻👏🏻✨ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/gcqqmG0RWK&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/gcqqmG0RWK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; (((Valerio Maggio))) 🇺🇦 (@leriomaggio) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leriomaggio/status/1564913412064399362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 31, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At lunch there is a &lt;strong&gt;Pyladies lunch&lt;/strong&gt;, we all sit together with many ladies including the organisers of PyLadies Paris and PyLadies Berlin. We also talked about what we did recently that we feel happy about and everyone is just so amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you are at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@EuroSciPy&lt;/a&gt; come and join us for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyladies?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyladies&lt;/a&gt; lunch. Wednesday, 31.08 room 028.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone welcome! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4bhz4js8zH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/4bhz4js8zH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; PyLadies Paris (@PyLadiesParis) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PyLadiesParis/status/1564608220483682312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;August 30, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, there are a lot of talks about various libraries, including updates and technical stuff. I spent some time catching up on some work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening it is the social event! It’s a bit far from the city centre and we all have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Yesterday, our conference’s social event took place in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sandoase?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Sandoase&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dreil%C3%A4ndereck?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Dreiländereck&lt;/a&gt; We hope all the attendants enjoyed it as much as we did!&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EuroSciPy2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EuroSciPy2022&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Basel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Basel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UaNtyJfRRa&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/UaNtyJfRRa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; EuroSciPy (@EuroSciPy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy/status/1565309047498313732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-4---conference-day-2&quot;&gt;Day 4 - Conference day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last conference day started with the interesting keynote about &lt;strong&gt;data privacy&lt;/strong&gt; by Kathrine Jarmul. Then again there are talks. Some of them are more academic-focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Great start of the conference day listening to the second keynote on ‘Supercharging Open Data with Open Privacy’ by Katharine Jarmul &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kjam?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@kjam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EuroSciPy2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EuroSciPy2022&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Basel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Basel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenData?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#OpenData&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenPrivacy?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#OpenPrivacy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Python?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Python&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/HW2AzWEtja&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/HW2AzWEtja&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; EuroSciPy (@EuroSciPy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy/status/1565260989938933761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch there is a lineup of talks about running Python in browsers: Presentation about &lt;strong&gt;Pyodide&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;JupyterLite&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;PyScript&lt;/strong&gt; (my talk). I think we are in an era where we are going through a revolution!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Do you know &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyScript?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#PyScript&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@cheukting_ho&lt;/a&gt; is showing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/dataviz?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#dataviz&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyscript_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@pyscript_dev&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@EuroSciPy&lt;/a&gt; now! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EuroSciPy2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EuroSciPy2022&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2Bbb8JphTE&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/2Bbb8JphTE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Astra Stefania Delprete (@astrastefania) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/astrastefania/status/1565325878300639235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we have networking drinks at Klara, and some people join us after swimming in the river. I am so jealous and wish I can do that too one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Good bye &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@EuroSciPy&lt;/a&gt; and thank you for the great conference. I am staying for the best part which is the sprint! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bHZJSia6Uk&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/bHZJSia6Uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho 💙💛 (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1565350980996431874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 1, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-5---sprint-days&quot;&gt;Day 5 - Sprint days&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;On the first hours of the sprint, close to 70 EuroSciPy attendees are deep in discussions and programming. Amazing to see so many people come together to contribute to the open source libraries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EuroSciPy2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EuroSciPy2022&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Basel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Basel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/UniBasel_en?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@UniBasel_en&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JSgwZCou4P&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JSgwZCou4P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; EuroSciPy (@EuroSciPy) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EuroSciPy/status/1565624047123275776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 2, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who loves open-source and believes the best part of the conference is the sprint, I of cause stay for the sprint. I am quite surprised to see there are so many people thinking the same - we have two rooms full of sprinters contributing to various open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trojan Source Code (Can we trust open-source anymore?)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I overheard my boyfriend listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twit.tv/shows/security-now&quot;&gt;a podcast&lt;/a&gt; that talks about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trojansource.codes/&quot;&gt;Trojan Source Code&lt;/a&gt;. I got interested and read &lt;a href=&quot;https://trojansource.codes/trojan-source.pdf&quot;&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a beginner friendly explanation if you don’t want to read it (but I cannot see why).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-lets-have-some-fun&quot;&gt;First, let’s have some fun!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.codingrooms.com/compiler?language=python3&quot;&gt;online Python console here&lt;/a&gt; and try running the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello world&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a standard “Hello world” right? How about this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello world&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;‮&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait! They LOOK the same!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes my friend, you are right. They look the same but are NOT the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unicode-uηicσժe-ⓤⓝⓘⓒⓞⓓⓔ&quot;&gt;Unicode! Uηicσժe!! Ⓤⓝⓘⓒⓞⓓⓔ!!!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know unicode is a bit wacky. But can you imagine a world that does not support unicode?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unicode started as an attempt to make computer characters display all writing systems in the world. I benefit from it when I was a kid, learning how to use a computer at school. Like all “good kids” I will secretly open Netscape to browse websites. At that time, no one really care about the encoding when designing website. Sometimes, I would browse a website in Chinese but was displayed in random symbols. Then I know it’s time to change the encoding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common unicode encoding is UTF-8, but there are many. For example, we use Big-5 for Chinese characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our favourite &lt;a href=&quot;https://emojipedia.org/&quot;&gt;emojis&lt;/a&gt; 💖😃🧸 are mostly added in 2014, and there will be more coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bidirectional-characters&quot;&gt;Bidirectional ‮characters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since unicode are designed to handle all writing system, and some writing systems (like Arabic and Hebrew) are reading and writing form right to left, oppose to left to right, what we English speakers are used to, there needs to be a way to tell the computer to “read” and display the characters from right to left. That way, is a set of “invisible” characters that indicate the directions of the text - Bidirectional characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using bidirectional characters where it is not suppose to be, like codes, then it is not just weird, but it can cause more harm than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trojan-source-code&quot;&gt;Trojan Source Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know the story about the Trojan Horse, hiding solders in a huge horse that was suppose to be the gift. This is what Trojan Source Code is like, hiding in the source code. In the paper the researchers listed 3 types of Trojan Source Code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-early-returns&quot;&gt;1) Early returns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By hiding the bidirectional characters and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement in the comment, what appear to be harmless comment can force a function end early and leave out codes that needed to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trojan-source-early-returns.png&quot; alt=&quot;Early returns example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-commenting-out&quot;&gt;2) Commenting-out&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is common to have comments alongside the code to help readability. By strategically adding bidirectional characters, what appear to be code that are executable will actually be a part of the comment when executed. Using this can make the code behave not as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trojan-source-commenting-out.png&quot; alt=&quot;Commenting-out example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-stretched-strings&quot;&gt;3) Stretched strings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to commenting-out, what appear to be not included in a string can be “put” inside the string with bidirectional characters and “change” the behaviour of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trojan-source-stretched-string.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stretched strings example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides there Trojan Source Code there are also similar exploitation with unicode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-invisible-character&quot;&gt;1) Invisible character&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiding invisible characters can be easily used to change behaviour of the code. Like replacing variable names or strings etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-homoglyphs&quot;&gt;2) Homoglyphs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, homoglyphs (which means characters that looks the same but aren’t the same) can be used to replace function names so the unexpected one will be executed instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/trojan-source-homoglyphs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Homoglyphs example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;should-we-be-worried&quot;&gt;Should we be worried?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the list of what works in Python you can see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nickboucher/trojan-source/tree/main/Python&quot;&gt;here at the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. You are welcome to try those Trojan Source Code and see if they works on newer versions of Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my personal opinion, the piece of advice I would give to other Pythonistas is that, use a editor with good syntax highlight or that will warn you if there’s hidden characters (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-31-warning-about-bidirectional-unicode-text/&quot;&gt;GitHub will give you a warning&lt;/a&gt; if the code file contains bidirectional characters). Keep a good habit of linting your code (&lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/pylint/&quot;&gt;Pylint&lt;/a&gt; is a good choice, it will also give you warning if it “sees” hidden characters) and double check before running any code, especially those that copy and paste form the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thats-only-the-beginning&quot;&gt;That’s only the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who works in open-source, I am always aware of the security of our work. We don’t want to accidentally spread malicious code and that harm the trust on the open-source software as a whole. There are more security issue that people keep finding and warning others, and we should all be aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank the researchers who publish their findings. If you would like to know more, make sure you check out their website: &lt;a href=&quot;https://trojansource.codes/&quot;&gt;https://trojansource.codes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What happened when your CI is stopping you from releasing?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to share my funny releasing stories during my short 18 months of maintaining the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-client-python&quot;&gt;TerminusDB Python Client&lt;/a&gt;. I love working in open-source, it has always been my dream to work mainly on GitHub and be part of the community. My journey involves some laughter 🤣, some panic attacks 😱 and tears 😢, but mostly, hugs and support 🙌 from my team and my friends in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story (or stories) I am going to tell you mainly consists of… laughter? With some sprinkles of panics, I would say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have encountered the most annoying situation in a release, not once but twice, both of them happened on a Friday (yes, release on Fridays always ends “well”). The situation is, your CI failed. “It was working a few hours ago,” I thought (on a side note, I also think that’s the best expression to go with “It works on my computer”) so I start looking at the build job log, hoping to get it done so I can start enjoying the weekend. But it’s not always that straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-1---a-tasty-mistake&quot;&gt;Chapter 1 - A Tasty Mistake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first encounter, I was released with my cool colleague Robin, he is the CI god in my team so I am in good hands. We looked at the log, and we found a slightly weird message: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AttributeError: module 'virtualenv.activation.python' has no attribute 'PestythonActivator'&lt;/code&gt; My first reaction, has it been hacked? &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PestythonActivator&lt;/code&gt; sounds … yummy 😋 … if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We of cause, like all good developers do, put the error message online and look for clues, we quickly found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1857&quot;&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; and boi, we are not the only souls that got crushed by a “timely” release of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; just a few hours before us. Since the lastest version of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; got installed every time we create the CI build job on Travis, it fails even we have done nothing. Of cause we didn’t point fingers at other maintainers, they are just as hardworking as us and it’s human to make mistakes. We are faced with 2 options, roll back to the previous release or wait for the patch of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; to get released. As the devs of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; did a lighting fast patch, we have chosen option 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it was… fun and tasty! At least, it is very obvious what had happened and the problem gets solved very quickly and everyone was happy. It’s not so… smooth in my second encounter of an “impossible” bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-2---you-see-but-you-do-not-observe&quot;&gt;Chapter 2 - You see, but you do not observe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time there’s only one challenger, that’s right, ME! I think that’ i have grown wiser since the last incident that was like 9 months ago so I am all good “Release is not scary, I got this!” I spoke too soon. This time, it’s the notorious &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'importlib.metadata'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, why is it notorious? Because it is caused by the version difference of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Python&amp;lt;=3.7&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Python&amp;gt;3.7&lt;/code&gt;. From Python 3.8 it has been added to the Python standard library so this error is EVERYWHERE. When I start to search for it, there are a million threads about this error and I cannot pinpoint a single library that I depend on that causes this error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I took a deep breath and think “Sherlock time! 🔍” I try to make sense out of the situation here, I looked at the status of all my GitHub action (yes we have switched from Travis to GitHub Action) build status and discover it was not a problem 2 days ago, it must be a recent release. So I looked through my list of dependencies and find the suspect. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tox&lt;/code&gt; got the most recent release, I thought I hit the jackpot and do what I think makes the most sense: Open an issue then roll back to a previous version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was WRONG! The problem persists even when I roll back to the previous version and a friendly GitHuber (I guess is the maintainer of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tox&lt;/code&gt;?) also confirm that it’s not a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tox&lt;/code&gt; error, but suggest I look at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pip-tools&lt;/code&gt; instead. I scratch my head “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pip-tools&lt;/code&gt;? I didn’t have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pip-tools&lt;/code&gt; in my dependencies…” But I looked anyway, and found that they actually have an even more recent release and there is indeed a patch fixing that bug coming in. Which means that if I tried to release just slightly later I may not discover the bug! (I can say I am lucky 🍀, right?) I found out that I do have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pip-tools&lt;/code&gt; in the dependency list in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tox&lt;/code&gt; set up (hence the confusion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited and even ask if the release will be on PyPI soon, and you guess what? GitHub action is down! (I said I am lucky! 🍀) Ok, both &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pip-tools&lt;/code&gt; and I cannot release anything at that moment so just drink more coffee ☕ and chill I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, GitHub action is back in action and it’s a happy ending for everybody. I feel that I have achieved something. When I figured what is broken I was really happy and feel on top of the world. I guess that’s how Sherlock Homes feels if he was real?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>EuroPython Online is still EuroPython</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year, due to COVID-19, all of the conferences since March was cancelled or went online. It hit quite hard on me cause I miss all my friends. We all live in different cities, countries or even continents and we only got a few times that we can meet and hang out during the conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, after organising and participating at EuroPython. I would say that, even though you cannot replace meeting physically at a venue with the community, the online experience is still very “EuroPython”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;europython-and-me&quot;&gt;EuroPython and me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first EuroPython that I attended was 2018. It was in Edinburgh, UK and I was a relatively new speaker. I was planning to travel with a friend but she had an accident before the conference and was not able to attend. I didn’t know anyone there at the beginning. But things changed fast. I remember I met some of my best friends in the community there for the first time. The community was so welcoming and I was quickly recognised due to my active involvement in volunteering work. (Also thanks to my lightning talk which I statically complaining about Window 7, I think what happened after this talk is a great pub story 🍻).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, it was in Basil, Switzerland. This time I travel with 3 more speakers form London (we are all ladies, we rocks). It makes the experience so difference. We share rooms and we often do things together. I was invited to be one of the organisers so I am more involved in the preparation and volunteering work (so I drag my roommates into volunteering as well). The most incredible volunteer task is to put stickers on all the batteries 🔋 that we gave out (with the amazing PewPew device) as souvenirs. It was like working in a factory in the 80s but all workers there are nerds (we tell nerd jokes while we work) and didn’t get paid. It was lots of fun. I also made new friends, have lots of giggles and I am happy to see my roommates who were new to EuroPython enjoy it too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this year, it was scheduled to be in Dublin, Ireland, but we went online. I was involved more in the organisation as the team shrinks and each of us needs to take more tasks on our shoulder. I was a bit sceptical whether the online conference will turn out okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;What do I like about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/EuroPython?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; 2020 most? The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/europython?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; organising team, the sprint with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TerminusDB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TerminusDB&lt;/a&gt; , the Mate workshop by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gilgamezh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@gilgamezh&lt;/a&gt; 😄 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/cMHzwl82tt&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/cMHzwl82tt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cheuk Ting Ho (@cheukting_ho) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1287520225450237953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;europython-online-is-still-europython&quot;&gt;EuroPython online is still EuroPython&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the conference started, actually I started to realise that, though the format and the tasks have changed, the split of EuroPython has not changed. The organising team is so good at facing many challenges (including the first keynote speaker missed her slot because of the timezone confusion). People are genuinely nice and going very easy on us about all the unexpected that happened. Attendees will help each other if someone is confused about where to find the talk. The organising team just work perfectly together, covering each other if someone needs help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it comes to the sprint. Oh boy, that was unexpected how engaging people are, despite that the sprint is carried out online. It is the first time I am a project leader in a sprint and I was not expecting people will be interested in our project and made so many valuable contributions. I feel the love 💕 form the community. What’s better is that my colleague who was new to this was impressed by our Python community. I am so proud of being a Pythonista!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For what I miss the most, the possibility of making new friends and get to know people around the world and understanding their culture. It is still there! One of the organisers from Argentina shows us how to prepare a must-have in their local sprint - a caffeinated drink called Mate (I thought it’s a cocktail🍹). It is not just a drink but there’s so much culture behind it and wow my eyes were opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is EuroPython 2020, it’s online but it’s still the EuroPython that we know and love.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shiny App in Python? Bokeh + Jupyter notebook</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While I am preparing my Data Science tutorial today, I suddenly have an idea of making an interactive plot with Bokeh and Jupyter notebook. I have a feeling that it’s possible because I was looking at the Bokeh widgets last week and I know that you can link up a Bokeh widget with a plot to change its appearance. It was a brave idea and I am happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing so, I learn a thing or two about Bokeh and to be honest, this actually reminds me about Shiny in R. A few years ago, my friend and I had a conversation about how useful Shiny is and we wish there is something similar in Python. Here you go! It’s not exactly the same but, in my opinion, after coding in Python full time for a few years, it is better than a Shiny app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-bokeh&quot;&gt;What is Bokeh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who do not know Bokeh, it’s an interactive visualisation library for modern web browsers. It allows you to create an interactive graph with just Python (of cause if you can code in JS you will get some bonus control over it). You can render your interactive graph as an html or embedded it in the Jupyter notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to learn more about Bokeh, you can watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://cheuk.dev/videos/cj_qru_4jj4&quot;&gt;my tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prerequisite&quot;&gt;Prerequisite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create something like I did - an interactive plot with Bokeh, you will have to be able to code in basic Python. Have some idea about Bokeh (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; is your best friend here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, you will have to be able/ happy to write a bit of JavaScript. But don’t worry, you will only need to write some small code snippets of it and it is highly similar to Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-get-started&quot;&gt;Let’s get started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we will create an app that the user can use 2 slider bars to control a line trying to fit the data with the least sum of error square. I call it a linear regression simulator. The sum of error square is re-calculated whenever any of the slider bars are moved. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; src=&quot;/assets/html/line_reg.html&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think the best way is to show you the code then I will explain what we did in the code. Remember I will assume you have some basic idea about using Bokeh here. If you want to learn Bokeh, you can watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://cheuk.dev/videos/cj_qru_4jj4&quot;&gt;my tutorial here&lt;/a&gt;. I would also assume you know how to use Jupyter notebook and put the code in the cells and run them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s prepare our data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.425&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.785&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sum_error_eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum_error_sq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum_error_sq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum_error_sq&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'X'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Y'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;1.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3.75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;2.25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'b'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'X'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'A'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'X'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Y pred'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'X'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have a preset value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;, these are the slope and the intercept of the line that we are going to create in the graph. We also have a function &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sum_error_eq&lt;/code&gt; to calculate the sum of error square. Unfortunately, we cannot reuse this function in our JS code snippets and will have to implement the same in JS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have a dictionary that is the data. Originally in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Cheukting/legend_data/blob/master/linear-reg.ipynb&quot;&gt;my notebook&lt;/a&gt; I use pandas, but I think I will take away another prerequisite by just using a  dictionary here. Note that we have ‘Y’, which is for the actual points that we are going to plot with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;circle&lt;/code&gt; in Bokeh and ‘Y pred’ which is the “predicted” Y form the line equation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y’ = Xb + A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this will be used in the interactive line plot in Bokeh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we want to make the plot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;bokeh.layouts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;bokeh.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ColumnDataSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomJS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Slider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Div&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;bokeh.plotting&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output_notebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output_notebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ColumnDataSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot_width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot_height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x_range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y_range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'X'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Y pred'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line_width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line_alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slider_A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;js_on_change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callback_A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;change_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slider_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slider_A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, that’s quite a big chunk of code here, let’s crack it down bit by bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output_notebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lets you output your “app” inline in the Jupyter notebook, If you want to export it as an html and embedded in your blog (like I did above) you can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;output_file&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ColumnDataSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a source with the data that we have, a source created with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ColumnDataSource&lt;/code&gt; can let you pass this data to the Bokeh plots and JS Callbacks (that we will explain later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;figure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot_width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot_height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x_range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y_range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'X'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Y pred'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line_width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;line_alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;circle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'X'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Y'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;green&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are creating the plot, with the interactive line and the circle. Note that the line here is not interactive yet but we will use the JS callback to change the data in the source so it will change with the slider when we hook up the callbacks with the slider bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callback_b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomJS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;
        var data = source.data;
        var b_val = cb_obj.value
        var b = data['b']
        var A = data['A']
        var x = data['X']
        var y = data['Y pred']
        for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; x.length; i++) {
            b[i] = b_val
            y[i] = b[i] * x[i] + A[i]
        }
        source.change.emit();
    &quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callback_A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomJS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;
        var data = source.data;
        var A_val = cb_obj.value
        var b = data['b']
        var A = data['A']
        var x = data['X']
        var y = data['Y pred']
        for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; x.length; i++) {
            A[i] = A_val
            y[i] = b[i] * x[i] + A[i]
        }
        source.change.emit();
    &quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the callbacks that we will be hooking up the slider bars. There is one for each. You can see that we pass the source in the JS code snippets and we change it according to the the value that we received in the slider bar. The snippets above are when &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; slider bar’s value has been changed and the one below is for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Sum of error sq: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum_error_eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'X'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Y'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;change_text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CustomJS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;
                var data = source.data;
                var y_pred = data['Y pred'];
                var y = data['Y'];
                var result = 0;
                for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; y.length; i++) {
                    var diff = y_pred[i] - y[i]
                    result = result + diff * diff
                }
                div.text = &quot;Sum of error sq: &quot; + result;
             &quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;       
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we created a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Div&lt;/code&gt; object, it is just like a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; session in your html. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; will actually be interpreted as html. We also created another callback, this one is actually for changing the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;. Note that in the for-loop here we are doing exactly the same thing as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sum_error_eq&lt;/code&gt; but in JS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slider_b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Slider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;value of b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slider_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;js_on_change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callback_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;change_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slider_A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Slider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;value of A&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slider_A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;js_on_change&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'value'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;callback_A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;change_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can create the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Slider&lt;/code&gt; bars and hook them up with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;js_on_change&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;column&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slider_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;slider_A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we create the layout will all our components inside and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-make-a-dark-one-like-the-gif&quot;&gt;How can I make a dark one like the gif?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there’s two things that I have done to make it “dark theme”. First, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes&quot;&gt;Jupyter Themes&lt;/a&gt; to give my Jupyter a new look. The theme that I used is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;monokai&lt;/code&gt;. Then I use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;night_sky&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/reference/themes.html?highlight=themes#module-bokeh.themes&quot;&gt;theme from Bokeh&lt;/a&gt; (by the way, I made this theme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you had fun and will keep on exploring this cool functionality of Bokeh. If you have my tutorials, you can now watch them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCie_J9IohYO4hSsz4O2mDfQ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>How to be Pythonic? Design a Query Language in Python</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://py.amsterdam/2020/03/25/virtual-pyamsterdam-from-home-stayathome.html&quot;&gt;PyAmsterdam&lt;/a&gt; today and it was a lovely community. I get the chance to answer some questions that have been puzzling me for a while. I ask people to vote for me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://directpoll.com/&quot;&gt;DirectPoll&lt;/a&gt; (first time trying it) so I know what the community thinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-pythonic-a-thing&quot;&gt;Is Pythonic a thing?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a questions that I have been thinking since I was a naive Python Data Scientist. “Why I can’t just do it in a for loop?” came through my mind all the time. Why we have to follow certain convention in coding? Is Pythonic a thing or just peer pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/is_pythonic_a_thing.png&quot; alt=&quot;Poll of Is Pythonic a Thing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost 90% of you things that it really is a thing. (35 votes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-like-sql&quot;&gt;Who like SQL?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I am not a fan of SQL. Date back to my first data science job I was furious about writing thousand links of SQL just to get some aggregated results. Joining tables are not fun as mistakes can be made easily. As we are designing a new query language in TerminusDB, I want to know what people things about SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/who_like_sql.png&quot; alt=&quot;Poll of Who like SQL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am surprised that 70% of you like SQL! Hmmmmm… (38 votes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-one-do-you-prefer&quot;&gt;Which one do you prefer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the time I was translating WOQLjs to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.terminusdb.com/2020/01/20/design-a-query-language-client-for-pythonistas-and-data-scientists/&quot;&gt;WOQLpy&lt;/a&gt; I wonder what how shall I make the query building more “Pythonic”. What would Pythonistas prefer? Chainable calls like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery().doctype(&quot;journey&quot;).label(&quot;Journey)&lt;/code&gt; or Pandas DataFrame style, multi-parameters calls like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WOQLQuery().doctype(id=&quot;journey, label=&quot;Journey&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. (I failed to show the result in the talk so here you go!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/which_one_do_you_prefer.png&quot; alt=&quot;Poll of Which one do you prefer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Pandas, the most popular data manipulation library in Python uses the multi-parameters calls, I am not surprised that 80% of you would prefer that. (25 votes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have missed the talk, you can now watch it &lt;a href=&quot;/videos/hl7xl7kurkg/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to catch me streaming live, follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho&quot;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;oot-is-recrooting&quot;&gt;OOT is recrOOTing!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optoutools.com/&quot;&gt;open-source project&lt;/a&gt; building tools to help women engage with healthy online discussion. We rely on donations and people’s time to build tools that fight online misogyny and harassment. If you can spare some hours of your week then take a look at the roles we need desperately need and see if you can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;user-researcher&quot;&gt;User researcher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe women should have equal access to digital spaces and want to help OOT better understand online misogyny using qualitative and quantitative data, then reach out! We need user researchers to actively engage with the community, compile research, and act as user advocates within the OOT maintainer community to help ensure we’re building tech that really protects the most vulnerable online. You’ll work closely with our social scientists and data scientists to make sure we’re building and researching the right things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ux--graphic-designer&quot;&gt;UX &amp;amp; Graphic Designer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an interest in designing products that live at the intersection of natural language processing, machine learning, politics in digital conversational spaces and feminism, then contact us! The role will be focusing on the usability of our browser extension and make our website look sweeet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;yes-i-am-here&quot;&gt;Yes, I am here!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one of the above describes you and you are interested in joining the team, please email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:opt.out.tool@gmail.com&quot;&gt;opt.out.tool@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; we would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Remote Working club - Tools to facilitate meetings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we have regular meetings to talk about the tools and strategies regarding remote meetings. I feel that it will be good to summaries the discussion and share the knowledge with people who are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-many-tools&quot;&gt;How many tools?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constant debate will be: would you prefer one tool for all or many tools each do their best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there will be a higher bar to learn to use many tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even for tech savvy people, many new tools can be overwhelming, there’s a learning curve. less tech-aware people it may be even harder - one or two at a time should be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on the other hands, there are people thinks that there is advantage to use the best tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the minimal set is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a question of - how many tools at the same time is too much, and also - how many in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone also points out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;we are reaching the point of too many tools - three is already too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;audio-vs-video&quot;&gt;Audio VS Video?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also discussion about is using video essential for a call? Or Audio is enough so people can focus on the task at hands? (e.g. note-taking, pair programming)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who praise using video calls do have a solid reason:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(Using only audio) missing the video connection, especially in sales its better for the personal connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, people who prefer audio also get a good point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reliability is one of the reasons to go primarily audio, also it frees the screen to use the tools like stickynote board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, I think it really depends on the use case that you have.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Celebrate our first Opt Out Tools meetup!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week (23 Jan 2020) we had our first Opt Out Tools meetup at Mozilla Berlin! Attendees compile of a team of international experts from different fields: data scientists, web engineers, project managers, digital marketers etc. It was a fruitful discussion as we have consolidated the goal for Opt Out Tools in 2020 and have formed workgroups to work towards our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-for-opt-out-in-2020&quot;&gt;Goals for Opt-out in 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable release:&lt;/strong&gt; We aim to release our first stable version of the Opt Out Tools browser extension in the 4th quarter of 2020 on Firefox add-on for the general public to use. But before, there will be beta versions for people who are interested to test and give us valuable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; Having stable financial support for Opt Out Tools is important for the development of the tools and the community. We will keep on actively looking for funding to apply for and potentially launch a crowd-funding scheme later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community building:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2020, we will keep on having more meetups and workshops for building the team and educating people about online misogyny. Hopefully, we will continue to have a strong partnership with Mozilla Berlin for community events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web capability:&lt;/strong&gt; With our strong team of web engineers, we will have a better browser extension interface and support more features. We will also improve our website so that our users have better experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger model:&lt;/strong&gt; Our data science team is massive; with them, we can have a more thorough study on the data and have a stronger AI model in detecting online misogyny. Our research team is also studying different types of abusive text in different cultural contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GDPR compliance:&lt;/strong&gt; We are fully aware of the importance of privacy and GDPR, we have reached out to professionals and seek advice. In 2020, we will continue using the data that we have for good (not for the bad)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;opt-out-workgroups&quot;&gt;Opt-out workgroups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that we apply our expertise and work efficiently towards our goals, we have formed workgroups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Science / Modeling: researching on performing machine learning on our data and deploying the best AI model we have for detecting abusive messages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research: researching definitions of misogyny and message context across cultures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web engineering: developing and maintaining the browser extension and the website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brand and Marketing: out-reaching and promoting Opt Out Tools, also managing our social media presence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Funding: sourcing and apply for suitable fundings, preparing our future crowdfunding campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in Opt Out Tools and want to volunteer or sponsor us, we would love to hear from you. Also, show us some love on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opt-out-tools/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/optoutools&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Newbie tips — 5 Advantage of Using GitHub Pages for Hosting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not a web developer, not yet. But you don’t have to be a web developer to set up a website with GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have an idea of putting all my work in one place, make it kind of like a portfolio. I brought a domain name — &lt;a href=&quot;https://cheuk.dev&quot;&gt;cheuk.dev&lt;/a&gt; (try to be cool) and went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamp&quot;&gt;IndieWebCamp&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin where they are happy to help with web newbies to get started. They recommended many options, including Wordpress and Blogger, to get your website set up. But since I have experience maintain the website for &lt;a href=&quot;https://python-sprints.github.io/&quot;&gt;Python Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, which uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, I feel more comfortable going down the GitHub route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing for a few days, I found there are some nice features of GitHub Pages for newbies to set up their first website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-its-free&quot;&gt;1. It’s FREE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s obvious that you don’t want to spend lots of money setting up your first website. It will be like a half hacking and half experimentation project so having a free hosting service is definitely encouraging for newbies to try out and get started. The only catch is you have to keep the repo and the code public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-support-custom-domain&quot;&gt;2. Support Custom Domain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages comes with the default domain name like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;https://&amp;lt;your_account_name&amp;gt;.github.io/&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/1514/0*VFTzosQZIxrF1wAC.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture explaining GitHub pages - domain name&quot; /&gt;
but you have brought a cool domain like I am. GitHub will let you use your own, just set up your custom domain following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site&quot;&gt;easy step by step guide&lt;/a&gt; and you are good to go. It may take a day or 2 for it to take effect though depending on your domain provider, after setup you can use your own domain like a pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-support-for-https&quot;&gt;3. Support for HTTPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I got a cool .dev domain, I need to encrypt with https. My friend told me it is not easy for a newbie to get an open SSL certificate. GitHub has partnered with the certificate authority &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;. After setting up your custom domain, select the Enforce HTTPS option.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/2908/0*Lz-SDhWlykqGN07L.png&quot; alt=&quot;picture explaining GitHub pages - HTTPS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-you-dont-need-jeykll-installed&quot;&gt;4. You don’t need Jeykll installed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, even your website is set up with Jekyll you don’t need to have Jekyll installed locally. I have been maintaining &lt;a href=&quot;https://python-sprints.github.io/&quot;&gt;Python Sprint&lt;/a&gt; for almost a year without installing Jekyll on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. In simpler terms, it’s a simple, blog-aware, static website generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub will build your website for you every time when you push to your repo named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt; if you have the files required by Jekyll (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_configure.yml&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layouts/default.html&lt;/code&gt; etc.) it will automatically build it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-using-git-version-control&quot;&gt;5. Using git version control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are an experienced GitHub user and fairly comfortable using git like I am, you will appreciate being able to do version control on your website. You can always try something and commit it, if you want to roll back to the previous version, you can just do a reset. You can get all the benefits that git gives you while designing your website. So for newbies who are no so sure if something works and need to learn from trying, git will give you a safe playground for it and GitHub will happily store all versions of your sites for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here you go, 5 advantage of using GitHub Pages for a starter website. If you are still not convinced to start your first website, I hope to see you at one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamp&quot;&gt;IndieWebCamps&lt;/a&gt; and I am happy to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Storing data like git - TerminusDB</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I have been to a meetup where a team of software developers from Dublin talks about their newest invention - TerminusDB, a graph database that stores data like git. My reaction was like, what? Imagine all the cool things you can do with git: time travel, branching and forking etc, you can do them with your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, TerminusDB is a graph database, meaning all data are stored in nodes and edges, makes it easy to extract relations between your data without all the hideous joins in relational SQL database.
In this article, let’s talk about the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is a graph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How git works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How TerminusDB works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-agraph&quot;&gt;What is a graph?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mathematics, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense “related”. The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called nodes and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common type of graphs is directed graphs and undirected graphs. The difference is, the edges of a directed graph have direction from a node to another but the edges of an undirected graph do not - it just linked two nodes together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*N7sgzupLg_9yXq_n.gif&quot; alt=&quot;types of graphs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of our data can be stored in a graph, and the usage of graph databases are more than what you think: knowledge graph in Google and NASA, recommendation engines, fraud detection in financial services, machine learning using graphs in deep learning and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*iOO7eoc9T2h1wt2u.png&quot; alt=&quot;example of knowledge graph&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;https://tech.ebayinc.com/research/explainable-reasoning-over-knowledge-graphs-for-recommendation/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-gitworks&quot;&gt;How git works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have not used git/ not familiar with git, let’s quickly recap how git works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*R9RZrgyWQFMfSNae.png&quot; alt=&quot;how git works&quot; /&gt;
https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/d-learn-workings-git/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you make changes in the repo, you will have to add your changes in the staging area, then you commit it. Git will store the new content and keep different commit as a series of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*pooMsU1ggBkhzBjK.png&quot; alt=&quot;git internals&quot; /&gt;
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact here, counter-intuitively, git does not store diff. Instead, it makes files into blobs and stores repo as a tree of pointers pointing to the blobs. It also stores the commits in sequences so it stores the history of the repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-terminusdb-works&quot;&gt;How TerminusDB works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see how similar TerminusDB is storing data in a chain of commits, layers in this case, just like git. However, it stores the diff instead (can see it having advantage in having a huge amount of data). For each layer, data, as a triplet consists of the edge and the nodes that it links, is stored either on the +ve plane or -ve plane (except the initial layer as everything was created).+ve means new data is added and -ve means that data is deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*5Tww22yWeosH4T8UdwXq8w.gif&quot; alt=&quot;how TerminusDB works&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you make a query, you search from the most recent layer (the HEAD layer) back, if it is found in the +ve plane, it exists in the database; if it is found in the -ve plane, it existed at some point in time but was deleted so it can be concluded that does not exist anymore in the database. If it is not found on either, it goes one commit back and does the same thing until hitting the initial layer which finding the data or not can conclude whether it exists in the database or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sRDGALZFqc19jRhtyHl0Bw.gif&quot; alt=&quot;how TerminusDB writes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making changes to the data in the database is like making a new commit in git. Internally, a layer builder would build the +ve and -ve plane (except the initial layer of cause) and then commit it to the series of layers, moving the HEAD forward. This makes time travel as simple as moving the HEAD just like git. Also, imagine you can make a new branch and create more layers and merge it back to the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so much potential in this genius design. I am already thinking about how this can give lot’s of advantage in processing data. I have talked to the team and they are super nice. As the product is quite new, they are happy to answer questions or hear feedback from you. Here are their contact details:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Build a Traffic Alert App with just one html — Ably + Tensorflow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will showcase the power of Ably and Tensorflow.js. Everything will be just on the frontend, in just one html. It’s a demo, in production you may not do things this way but you can have a feeling how powerful Ably is and how you can use deep learning model with just a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-ably&quot;&gt;What is Ably?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ably provide API to handle a lot of realtime Pub/Sub easily. In Ably, you can choose from Realtime, REST, MQTT or SSE library which is implemented in most of the popular languages and framework. For further information regarding Ably, you can visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ably.io/&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt;.
If you want to follow this demo and build your own, you have to sign up for a free Ably account and get an API key &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ably.io/signup#signup-box&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-get-started&quot;&gt;Let’s get started!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will need all the basic components in an html. We will start with this file as a skeleton:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;TfL traffic notifier&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    Your update: &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;message-text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;send-message&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Submit an update&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;textarea&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;result&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rows=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;10&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;width: 60%; margin-top: 10px; font-family: courier, courier new; background-color: #333; color: orange&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;disabled=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very simple and basic. We are more interested in the functionality but not the graphical design. We have an input field for the user’s input and a button to submit an update. The black text area underneath is for the messages from all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3116/1*bpFWHmn5sm8TgcnHeS11qA.png&quot; alt=&quot;demo picture 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-ably-realtime&quot;&gt;Using Ably Realtime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use Ably Realtime WebSocket connection to publish and subscribe to a channel for the updated form users. (Make sure you have the API key) Put this after the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and before &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Include the latest Ably Library  --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://cdn.ably.io/lib/ably.min-1.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Instance the Ably library  --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text/javascript&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Set up Ably's channel&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;realtime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Ably&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Realtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// put your API key here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;realtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;my_channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;publish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;message-text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Include the Ably library&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect to Ably (remember to replace with your API&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subscribe to my_channel and if there is update, add it to the text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the user inputs an update and clicks the button it will publish to my_channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, try our app. Put something at the input box and click the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/max/3092/1*O8fcVtPvA-Na1VjfW8fPlA.png&quot; alt=&quot;demo picture 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the update appear, you can also do an experiment for multiple users. Open the html files in another window or tab and repeat publish an update. You can see the ‘other user’ will also receive the update.
I would also like to point out that, using an API key like what we did is not a good practice in production code as it will expose your key to the public. To further understand how to do it properly, please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ably.io/documentation/core-features/authentication#token-authentication&quot;&gt;Ably’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tfl-information--ably-hub&quot;&gt;TfL information — Ably Hub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will be adding the TfL updates. Ably Hub which provides free, open-source data streaming for anyone to use (difference licence restriction may apply to different data source). If you have a source to donate, please get in touch with Ably’s team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Ably Hub is very similar to using Ably Realtime, you can also refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ably.io/hub/products/10#documentation&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; for the documentation specific to TfL data. Adding a new channel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tfl_channel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;realtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;[product:ably-tfl/tube]tube:disruptions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will update us when we have disruptions on any lines. If there is not, we will get an empty list. We can then check our update to see does it contains information about disrupted lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Getting the update form TfL streamer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tfl_channel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;toxic-detector--tensorflowjs&quot;&gt;Toxic detector — Tensorflow.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far all users can update no matter what they say, which is bad. Can we stop people publish toxic updates to our channel? Let’s try using AI and detect toxic comments and block them. Here we will use a pre-trained model and it is super easy, just add Tensorflow.js and the model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Include tf model --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow-models/toxicity&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And update the publish function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// When the user send an update, check if it is a toxic comment, publish if it is not.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;send-message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input_text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;message-text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;threshold&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;message-text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we set a threshold of 0.9 so if our model is very confident that it contains toxic text in any form, it will prevent publishing instead it will remind the user to be nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying it out, you will see that the speed of our message reduces significantly. Ably is a fast API as it uses WebSocket and the update in almost instant. However, making a prediction via the AI model takes a bit of time and is not ideal in terms of performance. Maybe we should not do everything at the frontend!&lt;/p&gt;
